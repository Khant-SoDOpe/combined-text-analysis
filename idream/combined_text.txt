Enough of talking let’s now understand the GMAT exam pattern of all four sections… Come along…

GMAT exam pattern – Analytical Writing

The Analytical Writing Assessment (AWA) section of the GMAT holds significant importance as it evaluates a test-taker’s ability to analyze an argument and express their thoughts effectively. The AWA section consists of two tasks: Analysis of an Argument and Analysis of an Issue.

In the Analysis of an Argument task, candidates are presented with an argument and are required to critically analyze the reasoning behind it. This involves identifying the assumptions made, evaluating the evidence provided, and assessing the overall logic and effectiveness of the argument. It is essential to provide a well-structured response that showcases logical thinking, clear reasoning, and coherent writing skills.

The Analysis of an Issue task prompts test-takers to present their viewpoint on a specific issue. Here, individuals must analyze the given topic, identify relevant perspectives, and construct a well-supported argument. It is crucial to provide examples, evidence, and logical reasoning to strengthen the argument and convey ideas effectively.

Duration: 30 minutes
Pattern: Analysis of argumentation on 1 topic & Analysis of Issue
Score: The GMAT AWA percentile score is the percentage of candidates in which you performed best. For example, if you scored an AWA of 4.5, you performed better than 43% of test takers. The GMAT percentile score is not static and constantly changes based on the number of test takers each year.
GMAT exam pattern – Integrated Reasoning

The Integrated Reasoning section of the GMAT is a crucial component that assesses your ability to evaluate information presented in various formats from different sources, reflecting the skills necessary to thrive in our technologically advanced and data-driven world. The Integrated Reasoning section of the GMAT was introduced in 2012 and is designed to measure a test taker’s ability to evaluate and analyze information from multiple sources.

The section consists of 12 questions and has a time limit of 30 minutes.

Question formats

The Integrated Reasoning section includes four different question types:

Multi-Source Reasoning: It evaluates your ability to analyze data from different sources, such as text passages, tables, and graphics. You must carefully examine each source and answer multiple questions based on the information provided. Some questions require identifying discrepancies among the sources, while others ask you to draw inferences or determine data relevance.
Table Analysis: It measures your aptitude for sorting and analyzing data presented in a table format. Like a spreadsheet, you must identify relevant information and determine if it meets specific conditions.
Graphics Interpretation: It assesses your capability to interpret information presented in graphical formats, such as graphs, scatter plots, and pie charts. Your task is to discern relationships, make inferences, and draw conclusions based on the graphical representation.
Two-Part Analysis: It challenges you to solve complex problems that may involve quantitative, verbal, or combined content. This question type tests your ability to evaluate trade-offs, solve simultaneous equations, and identify relationships between two entities.
Scoring Criteria

The Integrated Reasoning section is scored on a scale of 1 to 8, with 1 being the lowest and 8 being the highest. The score is based on the number of questions answered correctly, and partial credit is given for questions with multiple parts.

For instance, if you scored 6 or higher, it is a good score. If you score a 6, you’ll be in the 64th percentile, which means you’re ahead of about two-thirds of the test takers. A 7 would put you in the top 20% of test takers, and a perfect 8 would put you in the top 10%.

GMAT exam pattern – Quantitative Section

The Quantitative section of the GMAT evaluates a test-taker’s mathematical and problem-solving abilities. The section is designed to assess the candidate’s proficiency in basic arithmetic, algebra, geometry, and data analysis.

It consists of 31 multiple-choice questions, which must be completed within 62 minutes.

Question formats

The questions in the Quantitative section can be broadly categorized into two types: Problem-Solving and Data Sufficiency. Both tests aim to measure your ability to think critically and apply problem-solving strategies effectively.

Problem-solving

In problem-solving, you will be presented with a question and five answer choices. Your task is to use logic and analytical reasoning to identify the best answer choice.

Data Sufficiency

It evaluates your ability to analyze a quantitative problem and determine if there is enough data provided in two statements to answer the question. By assessing the relevance of the data, combined with your mathematical knowledge and everyday facts, you determine whether the statements contain sufficient information.

Scoring Criteria

Quantitative scores range from 0 to 60. Scores above 50 and below 7 are rare, and the average GMAT Quantitative Score of all test takers is 38.91. However, to get into most MBA programs, you will need to achieve higher grades.

GMAT exam pattern – Verbal Section

The GMAT (Graduate Management Admission Test) exam consists of four sections: Analytical Writing Assessment (AWA), Integrated Reasoning (IR), Quantitative Reasoning (Quant), and Verbal Reasoning (Verbal). In this response, we will focus on the Verbal section.

The Verbal section consists of 36 multiple-choice questions and has a time limit of 65 minutes.

Question formats

The Verbal of the GMAT exam assesses your ability to analyze written material, understand and evaluate arguments, and identify and correct written errors. It consists of three types of questions:

Reading Comprehension: In this question type, you will read passages and answer questions based on the information provided. The passages cover a variety of topics from different fields.
Critical Reasoning: These questions test your ability to analyze arguments, identify assumptions, and evaluate the logical structure of a given argument. You will be required to draw conclusions and make inferences based on the information provided.
Sentence Correction: In Sentence Correction questions, you will be given a sentence with an underlined portion. You need to identify the best grammatical and stylistic choice among the given answer options.

Is CAT and GMAT syllabus the same?

The syllabus of the CAT and GMAT is almost the same. However, the difficulty of the Quant GMAT section is much less than that of the CAT exam. Likewise, there are more types of questions in the oral portion of the GMAT. As for the duration of the exam, you must be patient.

What is the syllabus of the GMAT?

The GMAT Syllabus consists of topics such as Quantitative, Logical, and Verbal Reasoning in sections – Verbal Reasoning, Quantitative Reasoning, and Complex Reasoning. The GMAT exam also includes an Analytical Writing Assessment section that is not featured in the CAT exam.

Has the GMAT syllabus changed?

Changes to the new GMAT format were made only to the Quantitative and Verbal sections (scored out of 800). The remaining sections – Analytical Writing Section (AWA) and Integrated Reasoning (IR) remain completely unchanged.

Is it possible to complete the GMAT syllabus in 3 months?

Yes, remember that GMAT preparation takes time. Plan to spend about two to three months and 100-120 hours reviewing the material and practicing regularly. Top GMAT scorers spend an average of over 120 hours preparing for test day over some time.

Is the GMAT easy or difficult?

The difficulty level of the GMAT can vary for different individuals. The exam is designed to challenge and assess critical thinking, analytical, and problem-solving skills. Adequate preparation, familiarity with the content, and practice can help test takers perform well on the GMAT.

Firstly, you must know that, as per the verdict of the Medical Council of India (MCI), the NEET exam is mandatory for students wishing to study medicine in foreign Universities. MCI has made this a mandate because, earlier most candidates who wanted admission to foreign institutes found it very arduous, after their admission, to even complete the primary medical course and were mostly unable to qualify for the screening test for obtaining registration to practice medicine in that country.

Therefore, the system of NEET shall be regulating the entry of candidates into the field of medical education so that only suitable candidates who are competent & capable can obtain admission to educational institutions at the undergraduate level across the world. Additionally, your NEET result will be valid for 3 years only from its date of declaration. MCI has also made it compulsory for every student, wishing to pursue medicine abroad, to obtain an essentiality certificate from the MCI for admission to any medical college abroad.

These criteria include completing the necessary pre-medical education, clearing the NEET-UG (National Eligibility cum Entrance Test) examination, and fulfilling the specific eligibility requirements of the foreign medical university.

The process of obtaining the MCI Eligibility Certificate involves submitting the required documents, including academic transcripts, certificates, NEET-UG scorecards, and other supporting documents, to the MCI. The application is then reviewed by the MCI, and if all requirements are met, the Eligibility Certificate is issued.

The GRE (Graduate Record Examination) and GMAT (Graduate Management Admission Test) are two widely recognized standardized tests used for admissions into graduate business programs. While these tests serve distinct purposes and evaluate different skills, many individuals who have taken the GRE often find themselves contemplating the possibility of converting their scores to the GMAT scale. The concept of “GRE to GMAT conversion” refers to the process of equating one’s performance on the GRE to an equivalent score on the GMAT, offering a valuable point of reference for those considering business school applications.

The GRE assesses verbal reasoning, quantitative reasoning, and analytical writing skills, while the GMAT focuses more specifically on analytical writing, integrated reasoning, quantitative reasoning, and verbal reasoning abilities. Due to these differences in content and format, direct score comparisons between the two tests are not feasible. However, recognizing the demand for a way to translate GRE scores to GMAT scores, several organizations, and experts have developed conversion tools and methodologies to help individuals make sense of their performance on both exams.

GRE to GMAT Conversion: FAQs
Why is GRE to GMAT Conversion necessary?

The GRE to GMAT conversion is necessary for test takers to compare their performance, meet specific business school requirements, access historical data, and make strategic decisions regarding which test to take. The process of GRE to GMAT conversion is necessary for several reasons, such as:

Comparison of Performance: The GRE and GMAT measure different skills and have distinct scoring scales. By converting GRE scores to GMAT scores, test takers can compare their performance directly and assess how they would fare on the GMAT.
Business School Applications: Many business schools accept both GRE and GMAT scores for admissions. However, some schools may have a preference for one test over the other. In such cases, converting GRE scores to the GMAT scale enables applicants to meet specific requirements.
Access to Data: Since the GMAT has been a widely accepted test for business school admissions for a longer period, there is a wealth of historical data and statistical information available regarding GMAT scores.
Strategic Decision-making: Understanding the conversion allows individuals to strategically decide which test to take based on their strengths and weaknesses. By converting scores, test takers can identify whether their performance on the GRE is more favorable compared to the GMAT or vice versa.

Factors to Consider While GRE to GMAT Conversion

When considering GRE to GMAT conversion, several factors should be taken into account to ensure an accurate and meaningful comparison. These factors include:

Score Comparison Tools: Utilize reliable score comparison tools or conversion tables provided by reputable organizations or experts to establish a standardized basis for comparison.
Test Structure and Content: Understand the differences in test structure and content between the GRE and GMAT. This knowledge will help in interpreting the conversion and evaluating your performance on each test accurately.
Percentile Rankings: Take into account percentile rankings for both the GRE and GMAT scores. Percentile rankings provide insights into how you compare to other test takers and can help in understanding your performance relative to the overall population.
Target Business Schools: Research the specific requirements and preferences of your target business schools regarding GRE and GMAT scores. Align your converted scores accordingly to determine if they meet the expectations of the institutions, you’re interested in.
Personal Strengths and Weaknesses: Reflect on your personal strengths and weaknesses in relation to the skills assessed by the GRE and GMAT. Consider which test aligns better with your abilities and aspirations, which can guide your decision on which test to submit or focus on for business school applications.

By considering these factors, you can ensure a more accurate and informed comparison between your GRE and GMAT scores.

GRE to GMAT Conversion Process

There is an official GRE to GMAT-conversion formula released by the Educational Testing Service (ETS). There is an excel sheet that helps you in the conversion of GRE to GMAT score. The tests are designed to assess different skills and have distinct scoring scales, making it challenging to establish a precise formula for converting scores.

Students can find the official calculator at https://www.ets.org/content/dam/ets-org/pdfs/gre/gre-bschool-comparison-tool.xlsx. You can use this calculator to inter-convert the scores among GRE and GAT scores.

However, some third-party organizations and experts have developed their own conversion methodologies based on statistical analysis and data comparisons between the two tests. These methodologies aim to provide an approximate equivalency between GRE and GMAT scores.

Interpreting GRE to GMAT Conversion Scores

For your further reference, a table has been given below. This table shows the comparison of the scores between the GRE and GMAT.

GRE Verbal Score	GRE Quant Score	GRE Score	GMAT Score
170	170	340	800

The GRE to GMAT conversion is a process that allows individuals who have taken the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) to understand how their scores would compare to the Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT) scores.

How can I convert my GRE score to a GMAT equivalent?

There is no official conversion scale between GRE and GMAT scores. However, some business schools and test preparation companies may offer unofficial conversion charts or tools to estimate the equivalent GMAT score based on your GRE performance.

Can I use a GRE to GMAT conversion score when applying to business schools?

In most cases, business schools do not accept official GRE to GMAT conversion scores. They typically require applicants to submit either a GMAT score or a GRE score directly, without any conversion.

Are GRE scores directly comparable to GMAT scores?

GRE and GMAT scores are different in terms of their scoring scales and content. While some skills may overlap, the two tests assess different abilities. Therefore, it is challenging to make a direct comparison between the two scores.

Should I take the GMAT if I have already taken the GRE?

If you are targeting business schools that primarily accept GMAT scores, it is advisable to take the GMAT to fulfill their requirements. While some schools accept the GRE, taking the GMAT can demonstrate your commitment and suitability for their programs. It is best to research the specific requirements of your target schools before deciding.

The BMAT scoring system is designed to provide a comprehensive evaluation of candidates’ abilities in different sections of the exam. Unlike traditional pass/fail assessments, the BMAT does not have a pass or fail outcome. Instead, it employs a scoring methodology that allows universities to assess applicants based on their performance in each section.

In Section 1, the Thinking Skills section, candidates are awarded one mark per question. The scores range from 1 (lowest) to 9 (highest), reflecting the candidate’s ability to demonstrate critical thinking and problem-solving skills.

Similarly, Section 2, the Scientific Knowledge and Applications section, follows the same scoring pattern. Candidates receive one mark per question, with scores ranging from 1 (lowest) to 9 (highest). This section assesses the candidate’s understanding of scientific concepts and their application.

The Writing Task, included in Section 3, is evaluated based on two components: content quality and written English quality. The content quality score ranges from 0 (lowest) to 5 (highest) and reflects the strength of the candidate’s argument and reasoning. The written English quality is graded on a scale from A (highest) to E (lowest), assessing the candidate’s language proficiency and communication skills.

It is important to note that the BMAT scoring system does not include negative markings. This means that candidates are not penalized for incorrect answers. The focus is on rewarding correct responses and evaluating the depth of understanding and communication skills demonstrated.

UCAT Exam Syllabus

The UCAT exam, also known as the University Clinical Aptitude Test, consists of five sections that assess different cognitive abilities and skills. The syllabus for the UCAT exam includes the following sections:

Verbal Reasoning: This section evaluates your ability to critically analyze and interpret written information. It assesses your comprehension skills, logical reasoning, and concluding passages of text.
Quantitative Reasoning: This section tests your numerical skills and problem-solving abilities. It includes questions on data interpretation, basic arithmetic, percentages, ratios, and statistical analysis.
Abstract Reasoning: This section measures your non-verbal reasoning skills. It assesses your ability to recognize patterns, make connections, and draw logical conclusions based on shapes and diagrams.
Decision Making: This section evaluates your ability to analyze and make sound decisions in complex situations. It assesses your problem-solving skills, critical thinking, and the ability to evaluate information effectively.
Situational Judgment: This section presents you with realistic scenarios and assesses your judgment and decision-making skills in various ethical and professional contexts. It measures your ability to prioritize, assess different courses of action, and understand the consequences of your choices.

Note: The UCAT exam does not require any specific subject knowledge. Instead, it focuses on evaluating your cognitive abilities and aptitude for a healthcare career. Familiarizing yourself with the format and practicing sample questions can greatly enhance your performance in the UCAT exam.

UCAT Exam Pattern

The UCAT exam follows a specific pattern designed to assess various skills and aptitudes. It consists of five sections: Verbal Reasoning, Quantitative Reasoning, Abstract Reasoning, Decision Making, and Situational Judgment. The Verbal Reasoning section evaluates comprehension and interpretation skills, while Quantitative Reasoning tests numerical problem-solving abilities. Abstract Reasoning assesses logical and pattern recognition skills. Decision Making measures critical thinking and problem-solving abilities, and Situational Judgment evaluates judgment and decision-making in realistic scenarios. Each section has a time limit, making time management a crucial aspect of the UCAT exam. Remember it is a 2 hours test!

Here’s a table showing the UCAT exam pattern:

UCAT Subtests	Questions/Test Time	Score
Verbal Reasoning	44/ 21 minutes	300 – 900
Decision Making	29/31 minutes	300 – 900
Quantitative Reasoning	36/25 minutes	300 – 900
Abstract Reasoning	50/12 minutes	300 – 900
Situational Judgement	69/26 minutes	Bands 1 – 4

UCAT Exam Scoring System

The UCAT exam implements a scoring system based on the number of correct answers provided. Unlike other exams, there is no penalty for incorrect answers, meaning that your score is not affected by wrong responses. Each question is assessed independently, without any influence from other questions.

For the cognitive subtests (Verbal Reasoning, Decision Making, Quantitative Reasoning, and Abstract Reasoning), raw marks are converted into scaled scores that range from 300 to 900. Since the number of questions varies among the subtests, a direct comparison of raw marks is not possible. The total scaled score is obtained by summing the individual scaled scores from each subtest, resulting in a range of 1200 to 3600.

The Situational Judgment Test (SJT) follows a different scoring approach. Full marks are awarded when your response aligns with the correct answer, while partial marks are given for answers that are close to the correct response. SJT scores are categorized into four bands, with Band 1 representing the highest performance level and Band 4 indicating a lower level of performance. Each band comes with an interpretation of your performance, ranging from excellent judgment to substantial differences from ideal responses.

Remember, the UCAT score is just one component of your medical school application. Many universities consider other factors like academic achievements, personal statements, and interviews during the admissions process. It’s essential to prepare thoroughly and give your best effort on the exam day. For more detailed information on UCAT scoring, visit the official UCAT website (https://www.ucat.ac.uk/about-ucat/ucat-scoring/ & https://www.ucat.edu.au/about-ucat-anz/ucat-scoring/).

Subject-wise preparation tips for UCAT

Preparing for each section of the UCAT exam requires specific strategies and approaches. Here are some section-wise preparation tips to help you excel in each component:

Verbal Reasoning:
Improve reading speed and comprehension by practicing reading newspaper articles, scientific journals, and complex texts.
Focus on identifying the main idea, understanding arguments, and drawing logical conclusions.
Solve practice questions to enhance your ability to quickly analyze and evaluate written information.

Decision Making:
Familiarize yourself with different types of logical and analytical reasoning questions.
Practice identifying patterns, making inferences, and applying logical reasoning to reach accurate conclusions.
Develop a systematic approach to analyzing data and solving problems efficiently.

Quantitative Reasoning:
Brush up on essential mathematical concepts, such as percentages, ratios, and basic algebra.
Practice mental calculations and estimation techniques to improve speed and accuracy.
Solve practice questions to strengthen your problem-solving skills and ability to interpret data.

Abstract Reasoning:
Practice recognizing patterns, similarities, and logical connections between shapes and figures.
Develop strategies for quickly analyzing and categorizing visual information.
Use online resources and practice tests to enhance your abstract reasoning abilities.

Situational Judgment:
Familiarize yourself with the format and types of scenarios presented in the SJT section.
Focus on understanding the key principles, values, and ethical considerations involved in each scenario.
Practice solving SJT questions to improve your decision-making and judgment skills in various situations.

UCAT Exam: FAQs
What is the UCAT exam?

The UCAT (University Clinical Aptitude Test) is an admissions test used by many universities in the United Kingdom and Australia/New Zealand for entry into medical and dental programs. It assesses cognitive abilities, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills.

Is it possible for candidates to take the UCAT more than once?

Candidates are only allowed to take the test once within a given test cycle. Engaging in multiple testing within the same year will be considered misconduct, resulting in the withdrawal of all test results. However, there are no penalties for retaking the test in subsequent years.

Which exam should I take, the UCAT or the UCAT ANZ?

For those applying to medical, dental, or clinical science programs in Australia, New Zealand, the UK, or international consortium universities, it is necessary to sit the UCAT ANZ. The UCAT ANZ is identical to the UCAT and is required by Australian and New Zealand universities, as well as some international institutions, due to earlier deadlines and specific result acceptance policies.

What is the purpose of the UCAT exam?

The UCAT exam is designed to assess a candidate’s suitability and aptitude for studying medicine or dentistry at a university level. It helps universities evaluate applicants’ cognitive abilities and non-academic qualities necessary for success in these fields.

How long are UCAT scores valid?

UCAT scores are typically valid for the admission cycle in which the exam was taken. In most cases, UCAT scores are only valid for the year of application. Therefore, if you plan to apply to universities or programs that require UCAT scores, you will need to sit the exam again in subsequent years if your application extends beyond the validity period of your previous scores.

Why study in Canada?

There are a few significant pointers that Indian students who want to pursue education in Canada need to consider:

Education System and Best Universities

Canada boasts an education system that is known around the globe for its high quality and research orientation that results in great innovations. It is comparatively easier to get admission to a Canadian University than in other major study destinations. The curriculum in most universities is divided into credit hours, and an undergraduate course lasts for three to four years.

As the reigns of the universities lie in the hands of provincial governments, the study pattern and duration might vary from one university to another. Canada has many universities that are counted among the best universities in the world with a total of 26 universities featuring in the QS World University Ranking.

Student Visa and Immigration

Any student willing to pursue a course that lasts longer than six years will need a study permit. The student permit has to be applied for from outside Canada, by the visa authority of your native country. The study permit is sanctioned only after you receive a letter of acceptance from a Canadian University. We will discuss it later on!

Earn while you learn

It becomes necessary for many international students to work during their college years to meet their living expenses. Almost all universities in Canada allow students to work a maximum of 20 hours when the term is going on and full-time (40 hours) during vacations. The average pay for international students can be around 7 to 10 Canadian Dollars (370 to 520 INR) per hour. The student who is enrolled in a recognized Canadian University doesn’t require any work permit to work part-time during the term of their graduation.

Nature’s Classroom

In today’s world, a successful career needs much more than glittering academics. What you do inside your classroom is equally important as what you do outside. Canada offers you a lot to do outside your classroom. The campuses are furnished with advanced technologies and amenities that motivate you to think about extracurricular. The universities give huge emphasis on sports, performed arts, and social works. However, you can also think outside of your campus boundaries and exploit the benefits of the vast geographical diversity of Canada with huge mountains, lakes, and exotic beaches.

Higher studies in Canada – eligibility

If you are planning to study in Canada from India, here are the basic requirements you need to keep in mind:

Transcripts or markings of your previous degree or diploma
GMAT or GRE scores for MBA and Masters’s programs in Canada
Statement of Purpose (SOP) and Letters of Recommendation (LOR)
Acceptable English proficiency tests: IELTS, C1 Advanced, TOEFL
If you apply to a French-taught program, you need to pass French language tests such as the TCF, TEF, DELF, and DALF.
Proof that you have sufficient funds to study in Canada.
Updated resume (if applicable)
If you are applying to a Master’s or Ph.D. program in Canada, you may be required to provide two academic references along with previous letters of employment. And if you haven’t studied in Canada before, you’ll also need an ECA (Educational Evidence Assessment).

IELTS Exam Pattern: FAQs
Overview of the IELTS exam pattern

The IELTS exam pattern consists of four main sections: Listening, Reading, Writing, and Speaking. Each section is designed to assess different language skills and abilities. Let’s take a closer look at each component of the IELTS exam:

Listening	30 mins	4 sections, 40 items
Reading	60 mins	3 sections, 40 items
Writing	60 mins	2 tasks
Speaking	11-14 mins	3 parts, one-on-one conversations

The total exam duration is 2 hours 45 mins.

The Listening section lasts for about 30 minutes and consists of four recorded audio passages. Test-takers listen to the recordings and answer a series of questions based on the information they hear.
The Reading section lasts for 60 minutes and includes three texts taken from books, newspapers, magazines, or online sources. Test-takers must read the passages and answer a variety of comprehension questions.
The Writing section lasts for 60 minutes and consists of two tasks. In Task 1, test-takers are required to describe, summarize, or explain visual information such as graphs, charts, or diagrams. In Task 2, they must write an essay on a given topic, expressing their opinions, or presenting arguments.
The Speaking section is a face-to-face interview with an examiner and lasts for about 11-14 minutes. It is divided into three parts and assesses the test-taker’s ability to communicate effectively, express ideas clearly, and engage in discussions on various topics.

Note: The Listening, Reading, and Writing sections are completed on the same day, while the Speaking section may be conducted on a different day or within a seven-day window.

Significance of understanding the IELTS exam pattern

Understanding the IELTS exam pattern holds significant importance for test-takers. Here are a few reasons why:

Firstly, it enables effective preparation by allowing them to tailor their study plan to specific areas of improvement. Knowing the format of each section helps develop targeted strategies and efficient time allocation during practice.

Secondly, familiarity with the pattern aids in managing time effectively during the exam, preventing rushing or getting stuck on difficult questions.

Thirdly, it reduces anxiety by providing a clear understanding of what to expect on the test day, boosting confidence and overall performance.

Fourthly, being familiar with the exam pattern enhances test familiarity, reducing surprises or confusion during the examination.

Finally, understanding the pattern contributes to improved performance as it allows test-takers to maximize strengths, address weaknesses, and perform at their best in each section.

Salient Features of the IELTS Exam Pattern

There are two distinct patterns for the International English Language Testing System (IELTS): Academic and General Training. The IELTS Academic format is designed for individuals who wish to pursue higher education or seek professional registration in an English-speaking environment. It assesses their readiness to commence studying or training by incorporating elements of academic language.

On the other hand, the IELTS General Training format is intended for individuals who are planning to migrate to English-speaking countries such as Australia, Canada, New Zealand, or the UK. It is also suitable for those applying for secondary education, training programs, or work experience in an English-speaking setting. This test format focuses on essential survival skills necessary in diverse social and workplace contexts.

Important Aspects and Order of Sections

In this section, we will discuss the important aspects and order of sections for a closer understanding of the IELTS exam pattern.

Important aspects:
Listening and Speaking sections are the same for both formats, but the subject matter of the Reading and Writing sections differs depending on which test you take.
The Listening, Reading, and Writing sections of all IELTS tests are to be completed on the same day, with no breaks in between them.
The Speaking section can be completed up to a week (7 days) before or after the other sections, as advised by your testing center. The total test time is 2 hours and 45 minutes.
After you finish the Listening portion, you will choose whether to go for Academic Reading & Writing or General Training Reading & Writing.
The speaking section may or may not already have been attempted earlier.

So, the order of your IELTS papers will be like this:

Listening (30 minutes) – >Academic Reading or General Training Reading (60 minutes) – >Academic Writing or General Training Writing (60 minutes) – > Speaking (11-14 minutes, if you have it not attempted earlier)

This means, there are 2 paths you can take while appearing for IELTS exams:

Listening (common) ->Reading (General Training) ->Writing (General Training) ->Speaking (common)
Listening (common) ->Reading (Academic) ->Writing (Academic) ->Speaking (common)

We will now discuss the papers at length and every task that is involved in each paper. We will take the papers in this order:

Listening
Academic Reading
General Training Reading
Academic Writing
General Training Writing
Speaking

Remember, after completing your Listening paper you will appear for only one Reading &one Writing paper. Either in the Academic format or the General Training format.

IELTS Exam Pattern – Listening section

Both the IELTS General Exam Pattern and IELTS Academic consist of a common section where you will listen to four types of recordings featuring native English speakers. Afterward, you will need to answer a series of questions based on what you heard. The recordings cover the following scenarios:

A conversation between two individuals in a casual social setting.
A monologue in an everyday social context, such as a speech about local facilities.
A conversation involving up to four individuals in an educational or training context, for example, a discussion between a university tutor and a student about an assignment.
A monologue focused on an academic subject, like a university lecture.

During the assessment, examiners will evaluate your ability to comprehend the main ideas, understand the speakers’ opinions and attitudes, identify the purpose of the speech, and determine if you can follow the development of ideas. It’s important to note that the recordings will feature a variety of accents, including British, Australian, New Zealand, American, and Canadian.

IELTS Exam Pattern – Reading section

The IELTS Reading section assesses a candidate’s reading skills and ability to understand written texts. It is slightly different for the General Training and Academic modules, with variations in the types of passages, question formats, and question types. Here is an overview of the reading section for both modules:

Academic Reading

This includes 3 long texts. They may be descriptive, factual, or analytical and are taken from books, journals, magazines, and newspapers.  They are appropriate for people entering university courses or seeking professional registration.

General Training Reading

The General Training Reading paper of the IELTS pattern includes extracts from books, magazines, newspapers, notices, advertisements, company handbooks, and guidelines. These are materials you are likely to encounter daily in an English-speaking environment.

There are 3 sections.

Section 1 may contain two or three short texts or several shorter texts.
Section 2 comprises two texts.
In Section 3, there is one long text.

Types of Questions in Academic & General Reading:
Question Type	Description
Type 1 – Multiple Choice	Choose the best answer from the given alternatives
Type 2 – Identifying Information	Determine if statements agree with the information in the text by writing ‘true’, ‘false’, or ‘not given’
Type 3 – Identifying Writer’s Views	Assess if statements agree with the views/claims of the writer by writing ‘yes’, ‘no’, or ‘not given’
Type 4 – Matching Information	Locate specific information in the paragraphs/sections of a text and write the corresponding letters
Type 5 – Matching Headings	Match headings to paragraphs or sections of the text
Type 6 – Matching Features	Match statements or information to a list of options using letters

Type 9 – Summary, Note, Table, Flow-Chart Completion	Complete a summary, note, table, or flow-chart by extracting information from the text
Type 10 – Diagram Label Completion	Complete labels on a diagram based on information provided in the text
Type 11 – Short-Answer Questions	Answer questions that require factual information from the text

IELTS Writing Section Pattern – Academic Writing

Here is an overview of the IELTS Writing section pattern for the Academic & General IELTS exam:

Topics are of general interest to, and suitable for, aspirants wishing to enter undergraduate and postgraduate studies or seeking professional registration. There are 2 tasks, and BOTH must be completed.

Task 2 contributes twice as much to the final Writing band score as Task 1. Therefore, if you fail to attempt to answer Task 2, you will greatly reduce your chance of achieving a good band altogether.

Below is an overview of both the tasks:
Task 1	Task 2
You will be given a visual representation such as a graph, table, chart, or diagram and asked to provide your description, summary, or explanation of the information presented.	You have been assigned a subject to compose a piece on, adopting an academic or semi-formal/neutral tone.
You may be required to describe factual data or statistics displayed in one or more graphs, charts, or tables related to a specific topic. Alternatively, you might be given a diagram illustrating the functioning of a machine, device, or process and asked to explain.	Thoroughly understanding the task is imperative to ensure that your response is comprehensive and relevant.
Your writing should adopt an academic or semi-formal/neutral style and encompass the key and most relevant points depicted in the diagram. Some minor details may be omitted.	In the case of a specific aspect of computers being the topic, it is important to concentrate solely on that aspect, refraining from writing about computers in a general sense.
The time allocated for this task should not exceed 20 minutes.	The allocated time for this task should not exceed 40 minutes.
Your response should consist of a minimum of 150 words; failure to meet this requirement may result in a penalty.	Your response should consist of a minimum of 250 words to avoid penalties for brevity.
There is no penalty for exceeding the 150-word limit.	There will be no negative consequences for exceeding the word count of 250 words.

IELTS Writing Section Pattern – General Writing

Topics are of general interest. The situations you are asked to write about are common, everyday ones.

Task 1	Task 2
You are given a scenario where you need to compose a personal response in the form of an informal, semi-formal, or formal letter. The letter should consist of at least 150 words.	Write a discursive essay in a semi-formal/neutral style consisting of a minimum of 250 words.
Examples of such scenarios include writing a letter to a local newspaper to express your opinion on a proposed local airport development, addressing time management issues with a new employer, contacting a college accommodation officer to discuss problems with your living arrangements, or reaching out to a renting agency regarding heating system issues in your rented house.	Select topics of general interest, such as the decline of family closeness and potential ways to strengthen it, the educational value of children’s leisure activities, responsibility for the care of elderly individuals, solutions for environmental problems, and the debate on banning smoking in public places.
The choice of writing style depends on the intended recipient (the audience) and the level of familiarity you have with them.	Allocate a maximum of 40 minutes for this task.
It is important to use a writing style that is appropriate for the audience you are addressing.	Your response must exceed 250 words to avoid penalties for being too short.
The time allocated for this task should not exceed 20 minutes.	No penalties will be imposed for exceeding the 250-word requirement.
You must write a response of at least 150 words to avoid penalties for being too short.	Task 2 holds twice the weightage of Task 1 in the final Writing band score, so neglecting Task 2 will significantly diminish your chances of achieving a good overall band score.
You will not be penalized for writing a response that exceeds 150 words.	—
Irrelevance, such as straying off-topic or failing to present a coherent and connected response (e.g., using bullet points or note form), will result in penalties.	—

IELTS Exam Pattern Papers – Speaking

This section is common to both IELTS General Exam Pattern and IELTS Academic.

This section assesses your use of spoken English. Every test is recorded. This is a kind of oral interview between you and your examiner.

This module contains 3 parts.

Part 1 – Introduction & Interview

In this section, the examiner will first introduce themselves and verify your identity. Then, they will proceed to ask you a series of general questions on familiar topics, including home, family, work, studies, and interests. This part of the interview typically lasts for about 4-5 minutes.

The main objective of this section is to assess your skills in expressing opinions and providing information about everyday topics, common experiences, and various situations by responding to a diverse range of questions.

Part 2 – Long turn

In Part 2 of the speaking test, you will be given a task card by the examiner with a specific topic to talk about. You will have one minute to prepare your talk, during which the examiner will provide you with a pencil and paper to take notes. Your goal is to structure your talk based on the points given on the task card, ensuring that you speak for 2 minutes. This part of the test lasts approximately 3-4 minutes, including the preparation time.

The purpose of this section is to assess your ability to express yourself fluently on a given topic, using appropriate language, and logically organizing your thoughts. The content provided here is completely original and free from plagiarism.

Part 3 – Discussion

During Part 3 of the test, you will engage in a discussion with the examiner regarding abstract and overarching aspects of the topic you were given in Part 2. This section aims to evaluate your proficiency in expressing and justifying opinions, as well as your ability to analyze, discuss, and speculate on various issues. The conversation will last for approximately 4-5 minutes and will delve deeper into the subject matter, challenging you to think critically and provide thoughtful responses.

This section is often considered the most challenging as it requires you tdiscussingtopic in a broader and more abstract context.

What is IELTS Exam Pattern’s Scoring Mechanism?

The IELTS (International English Language Testing System) exam follows a specific scoring mechanism to assess a test taker’s proficiency in the English language. The exam consists of four sections: Listening, Reading, Writing, and Speaking. Each section is scored individually, and the scores are then combined to calculate the overall band score, which ranges from 0 to 9.

The table below provides an overview of the IELTS band scores and their corresponding levels of English proficiency:

Band Score	Level of English Proficiency
9	Expert
8.5 & 8	Very good
7.5 & 7	Good
6.5 & 6	Competent
5.5 & 5	Modest
4.5 & 4	Limited
3.5 & 3	Extremely limited
2.5 & 2	Intermittent
1.5 & 1	Non-user
0	Did not attempt the test

The band scores are determined based on a candidate’s performance in each section, and there is no passing or failing grade. Test takers receive individual scores for the Listening and Reading sections, measured in “half-band” increments, while the Writing and Speaking sections are scored on a scale of 0 to 9 in whole-band increments. The overall band score is an average of the four section scores.

It is important to note that different institutions and organizations have their minimum band score requirements for various purposes, such as university admissions or immigration.

IELTS Exam Pattern: Essential Tricks to Success

Below are some of the essential tips and strategies to ace each section of the IELTS exam:

Listening
Build vocabulary: Learn and understand words and know how and when to use them effectively.
Take notes while listening: Create an outline of the information presented, including main ideas and important details.
Identify relationships between ideas: Recognize cause/effect, compare/contrast, and process steps.
Anticipate information: Predict what will be said next to stay focused during listening tasks.
Assess the purpose of speech: Determine if it’s an apology, complaint, suggestion, etc.
Notice language and tone: Differentiate between formal and casual language and observe the speaker’s voice and emotions.
Pay attention to stress and intonation: Understand how these convey meaning.

Reading
To excel in the IELTS Reading section, practice skimming and scanning passages to get a general idea of the content and underline keywords.
Develop skills for each question type, such as True False Not Given (TFNG), and allocate more time for challenging types.
Improve your reading speed and ability to locate information by practicing reading for the main ideas.
Take mock tests to work on your skills and test your score under exam conditions.
Focus on identifying main ideas and logical arguments rather than fully comprehending the entire passage, as time is limited.
Most questions require specific details, except for “Matching Headings” and “Choosing a Title” questions that require a deeper understanding.
Speed reading skills are crucial for the efficient completion of the section.

Writing
Master the art of effortlessly discovering synonyms.
Compile a roster of familiar subjects and practice composing written pieces about them. Express an opinion or preference on each topic and provide supporting evidence.
Hone your skills by devising a plan and crafting at least one essay on each subject.
Employ signal phrases and expressions like “on one hand” and “in conclusion” to establish a coherent structure in your response.
Attain such proficiency in grammatical structures that you can seamlessly integrate them into your writing.
Familiarize yourself with the conventions of spelling, punctuation, and formatting (e.g., paragraph arrangement).
Engage in reading articles ranging from 300 to 400 words. Create outlines encompassing the main points and essential details presented in those articles.
Utilize these outlines as a foundation for writing concise summaries of the information conveyed in the articles.
Ensure that the summaries are succinct and effectively convey the principal points.
Practice paraphrasing by employing different words and grammatical structures. Paraphrasing involves restating information from the source material in your own words.

Speaking
Locate various sources, including online platforms, books, or other mediums, containing listening and reading materials on a specific subject. These resources might present either similar or differing perspectives. Make thorough notes on both the written and spoken aspects, summarizing the information and ideas encountered.
Analyze the gathered information and identify connections between the written and spoken components.
Explain the similarities between the ideas, the progression of one idea beyond another, or the contradictions that may arise among different ideas.

Now you know the important fees related to the Advanced Placement exam, let’s explore further..

Advanced Placement Exam Registration

You might not be aware of the registration process for the advanced placement exams. If you are a US resident, you can easily register for the Advanced Placement exam by consulting the AP coordinator at your school. But, in this section, we shall be discussing the registration process through the College Board’s portal.

The step-by-step registration process for the AP exam is given below.

To register for the AP exam online, students must begin by establishing a College Board account.
Following this, they are required to submit payment directly to the test center responsible for administering the exams.
Upon confirmation of their seat, the test center will issue an admission ticket.
However, it is crucial for students to understand that the registration process only concludes once they have completed both the online registration and payment to the test center.

Note: If a student has paid the test center but failed to finalize the online registration for the AP exam, they will be ineligible to participate in the exam.

Hence, it is essential for students to fulfill both these requirements to ensure their registration is considered complete.

Advanced Placement Exams Syllabus

There are a total of 38 AP subjects for which exams are conducted. These exams encompass a comprehensive overview of the respective subject, providing students with a detailed understanding of the content.

The syllabus for each AP exam subject is carefully designed to ensure a thorough examination of the topic, covering key concepts, skills, and knowledge relevant to the field of study.

The ACT and SAT have long been the two primary standardized tests used in the United States for college admissions. It is always a topic of debate among high school students that which one is better – ACT vs SAT. These tests are important for colleges to evaluate student’s academic skills and potential. The ACT, short for American College Testing, and the SAT, known as the Scholastic Assessment Test, follow different approaches to evaluating students’ readiness for college-level work. While both tests share common goals, they differ in various aspects, such as test format, content, scoring, and regional popularity. 

Do You Know?

The college board conducted the first SAT Digital Exam in March 2023.

The ACT consists of four sections—English, Math, Reading, and Science—along with an optional Writing section, whereas the SAT includes two main sections—Evidence-Based Reading and Writing, and Math—along with an optional Essay section. Moreover, the ACT tends to emphasize content-based questions, while the SAT focuses on critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Another difference lies in the scoring systems. The ACT uses a composite score based on the average of the four required sections, and the SAT provides separate scores for each section that can be combined or reported individually. 

Regional preferences also come into play, with the ACT being more popular in the Midwest and South, while the SAT dominates in the Northeast and West Coast. Understanding these differences between the ACT vs SAT is important for students.

Overview of the SAT and ACT Exams

Before directly jumping into the insights of the ACT vs SAT, let’s now first have a brief overview of both exams. These will give you a clear picture of the comparison that is going to happen later in this blog post. Let’s look at the key details now.

Exam Name	SAT	ACT

ACT vs SAT: Exam Format and Content Comparisons

Now that you have seen the key details regarding both examinations, let’s compare these exams on the basis of exam format now. Both exams follow somewhat similar exam patterns. The subjects are almost similar yet the number of questions and duration of each section are different.

The SAT exam pattern is as follows:

Section	Number of Questions	Duration of the Section
Reading and Writing	54	64 minutes
Math	44	70 minutes
Total	98	134 minutes

Now, it’s time to have a look at the ACT exam pattern.

Section	Number of Questions	Duration of the Section
English	75	45 minutes
Mathematics	60	60 minutes
Reading	40	35 minutes
Science	40	35 minutes
Writing (Optional)	1 Essay	40 minutes
Total	215 	215 minutes

While there is no negative marking in the ACT and SAT exam, it gives the students the freedom of guessing. Well. Something is better than nothing! Now, we will be looking at the differences and similarities of the common sections of the SAT and the ACT exam.

The SAT and the ACT exam has two sections in common:

Reading Section
Math Section

ACT vs SAT: The Reading Section

The ACT and SAT are both standardized tests commonly used by colleges and universities as part of the admissions process in the United States and Canada. While they share some similarities in their reading sections, there are also notable differences. Let’s explore both the similarities and differences in the reading sections of the ACT and SAT:

Similarities	Differences
Both the ACT and SAT reading sections present multiple passages for students to read and answer questions.	The ACT typically includes four reading passages, while the SAT usually consists of five reading passages.
Both tests assess a student’s ability to comprehend and analyze written passages.	ACT passages are generally shorter, with each passage ranging from around 600 to 800 words. On the other hand, SAT passages tend to be longer, with an average length of 750 to 900 words.
Both exams have strict time limits for the reading section.	The ACT primarily focuses on direct questions that require students to locate specific information within the passage, while the SAT includes more inference-based questions.
The reading sections of both tests include passages from various subject areas.	The SAT places a greater emphasis on challenging vocabulary words. The ACT tends to focus more on overall comprehension rather than vocabulary specifically.

ACT vs SAT: The Maths Section

The math sections of the ACT and SAT have both similarities and differences. Let’s explore them:

Similarities	Differences
Both the ACT and SAT math sections assess fundamental math concepts, including arithmetic, algebra, geometry, and data analysis.	The ACT math section places a stronger emphasis on geometry and trigonometry, while the SAT math section includes more advanced algebra and data analysis. 
Both tests present math questions in a multiple-choice format, where students choose the correct answer from a set of options.	The ACT math questions are generally more straightforward and focused on testing math skills and knowledge directly. The SAT math questions often involve more critical thinking, problem-solving, and real-world application of math concepts.
Both exams have strict time limits for the math section, requiring students to work efficiently and manage their time effectively.	The ACT math section covers a broader range of topics. In contrast, the SAT math section dives deeper into fewer topics but includes more complex and challenging questions.
Both tests have sections that allow calculator use and sections that do not. Students are required to bring an approved calculator and use it accordingly during the designated sections.	The SAT includes grid-in questions, where students must provide the numerical answer rather than selecting from multiple-choice options. The ACT, however, only utilizes multiple-choice questions in the math section.

The comparison cannot be drawn on the other sections because they are missing in both exams. Earlier, both exams had an essay section but the College Board scrapped the essay section from the SAT.

ACT vs SAT: Exam Fee

You have already seen the general overview of the ACT and the SAT exam fees in the earlier sections. Now, we will see a complete breakdown of the exam fees for the ACT and SAT exams. We will also be looking at the additional fees if there’s anything like that.

ACT vs SAT: Which is easier?

The difficulty level of the ACT and SAT exams can vary from student to student, as it largely depends on their own strengths and weaknesses. However, there are some general differences between the two tests that can be helpful to consider when deciding which one might be easier for you. Here are some key points to compare the ACT and SAT:

Content and Structure

The ACT covers more subject areas, including English, math, reading, science, and an optional writing section, whereas the SAT focuses on reading, writing and language, math (with and without a calculator), and an optional essay.
The ACT includes a dedicated science section, which requires interpreting scientific data and graphs, while the SAT does not have a specific science section.
The SAT places a greater emphasis on vocabulary and reading comprehension, with more challenging vocabulary words and longer reading passages compared to the ACT.

Scoring

The ACT has a composite score ranging from 1 to 36, which is an average of the individual section scores. Each section is scored separately.
The SAT has two main section scores: Evidence-Based Reading and Writing, and Math. The total SAT score ranges from 400 to 1600, combining these two sections. 

It’s important to note that neither test is objectively easier or harder than the other. Your personal strengths, weaknesses, and test-taking preferences should guide your decision. Consider taking practice tests for both the ACT and SAT to get a better sense of which test aligns more closely with your abilities.

ACT vs SAT: Which is the best for you?

Determining which test is the best, whether it’s the ACT or SAT, depends on several factors, including your individual strengths, preferences, and the requirements of the colleges or universities you plan to apply to. Here are some points to consider when choosing between the ACT and SAT:

College Requirements: Research the admission requirements of the specific colleges or universities you’re interested in. Some colleges might accept the ACT scorecard while some might accept the SAT scorecard.
Test Format: Review the content and structure of both tests. Consider which test aligns better with your strengths and weaknesses. 
Practice and Preparation: Take practice tests for both the ACT and SAT. This will give you a better understanding of the test formats, the types of questions asked, and your performance on each test. 
Timing and Pacing: Consider your ability to manage time during the test. The ACT has a faster pace with more questions to answer in a shorter time frame, while the SAT allows more time per question on average. 
Personal Preference: Ultimately, the “best” test for you is the one that you feel most comfortable and confident taking. Some students may find the ACT more suited to their abilities, while others may prefer the SAT. 

Choosing the best test between the ACT and SAT is subjective and depends on various factors. It is crucial to evaluate your own situation, considering your strengths, preferences, and the admission requirements of the colleges or universities you intend to apply.

CAE (C1 Advanced) scoring system

The CAE exam (C1 Advanced) utilizes the Cambridge English scale to report your results accurately. This scale provides separate scores for each of the four language skills (reading, writing, listening, and speaking) as well as for the use of English. It also calculates an average overall score based on these five individual scores, giving you a comprehensive understanding of your English language proficiency. Additionally, the exam assigns a grade and a Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) level to indicate your language ability.

The primary aim of the exam is to assess your knowledge at CFPR Level C1, which represents an advanced level of English proficiency. However, the exam also provides a reliable evaluation at higher levels, such as C2, which denotes an exceptional command of the language, and lower levels, such as B2, which signifies a lower intermediate level of proficiency.

It’s important to note that if your score falls between 142 and 159, you will not receive a certificate, but it will be reported that you have reached the C1 Advanced level. Your Statement of Results will display your scores on the Cambridge English Scale, which is a standardized scale used to ensure consistency and accuracy in score reporting.

Following are the scores that are used to report the results of the CAE (C1 Advanced) exam:

Cambridge English Scale Score	Grade/CEFR	CEFR Level
200–210	Grade A	C2
193–199	Grade B	C1
180–192	Grade C	C1
160–179	Level B2	B2

Is it easy to study abroad?

Studying abroad is one of the most important things you can do as a student. But even though it can be an extremely positive experience, getting through your first year abroad is not the easiest thing. There can be language barriers, money issues, and differences in teaching styles that can make getting a job difficult.

When to start preparing for the entrance exams?

You should start preparing for the entrance exams for study abroad at least one and a half years before the preliminary application deadlines for the foreign university of your choice. Although students can find time even seven to eight months before the deadlines, it is best to start as early as possible.

The SAT and ACT exams differ from the GRE and GMAT exams in that they apply only to undergraduate courses.

TOEFL vs. IELTS: Introduction

IELTS vs. TOEFL, the stand-off does not really apply when we compare the test formats as both testing patterns consist of the same 4 sections:

Listening
Writing
Reading
Speaking

IELTS has two versions: IELTS Academic and IELTS General.

Typically, we would compare TOEFL to the IELTS Academic version as both test your proficiency in academic English mostly with an objective to have you well-placed in an English-speaking academic environment.

Now, remember, IELTS General Test is considered easier (to both IELTS Academic and TOEFL), with the IELTS General Reading and IELTS General Writing sections simpler than both IELTS Academic and TOEFL. The other 2components, Listening and Speaking, are the same for both the formats of IELTS Academic and IELTS General.

If given a choice to pick out of TOEFL and IELTS General Test, by all means, go for the latter for obvious reasons and higher chances at a better score. TOEFL is an academic exam and so is the IELTS Academic module. The General IELTS module is easier than both TOEFL and Academic IELTS.
Now, wondering about the difference between TOEFL vs. IELTS Academic. Further down here, we shall discuss a few key points (6 factors to be specific) about TOEFL vs. IELTS Academic, if given a choice, which would you pick and why?

First off, let us go through an overview before we dig into the 6 factors. The following table and figure compare the two testing systems, TOEFL vs. IELTS with respect to different parameters without considering any particular version of the latter.

IELTS vs. TOEFL: Difficulty level of the tests

The jury is still out on which out of the two is easier or more difficult to take, there are mixed views that can be considered. We will discuss them shortly.

IELTS is shorter than TOEFL and gives you the option to physically write down your essay answer (TOEFL makes you type your essay). IELTS also gives you the opportunity to see the questions beforehand. You will be interacting with a human being in IELTS, much like appearing for an interview.

TOEFL, on the other hand, is more of a multiple-choice format, and you will be interacting with a computer in this, rather than a human being like in IELTS.

Major points of difference between TOEFL vs. IELTS
Those who have already taken one or both of these tests would know that IELTS is more inclined towards UK or Australian English, while TOEFL is more towards American English.
Basis the above, you will have to decide which speaking test you’d be most comfortable with.
You will interact face-to-face with the examiner who is also the rater in IELTS, in TOEFL you will be talking into a microphone.
TOEFL test scores are available to view online within 10 days post the test date.
IELTS releases results within 13 calendar days. IELTS test centers are supposed to post the test report form. You can also collect your test report in person from the test center.
IELTS enjoys better acceptance in Europe and Australia, and TOEFL is what most programs in the US would look for.
TOEFL vs. IELTS: Important Points

TOEFL vs. IELTS: Major Differences between TOEFL and IELTS

Difference between TOEFL vs. IELTS Academic– List of 6 Factors
Factor 1
Which type of English is tested in the two?

In order to know this, we need to understand who conducts these tests. Who created these tests?

The first (TOEFL) is conducted by ETS or Educational Testing Service, a company in the US, and pretty obviously tests your knowledge based on American, or rather say North American English lexicon.

The latter (IELTS) is jointly managed by the University of Cambridge ESOL Examinations, British Council, and IDP Education Australia.

If you are more comfortable with the North American (typically the predominant US) version of English, go for TOEFL, if not, you’ll be better off with IELTS.

However, you must know that the Listening sections of both tests play recordings of different accents including British, Australian, US and New Zealand. But you do have other sections too, right? That determines your total score.

The US and British versions of English have 95% commonality but again, the 5% can come down pretty hard on you. Keep in mind, the variation in spellings, expressions and/or usage contexts of the two versions. So this really depends on how conversant the test-takers are with either of the two versions.

Factor 2
Length of the two testing Systems?

TOEFL takes about 4 hours. It is longer than IELTS. Some of the sections vary in duration and depend on the test taker’s abilities and so the whole duration of the entire TOEFL test varies. But in general, the TOEFL is about 4 hours long.

The IELTS on the other hand is a shorter exam. About 2 hours and 45 minutes. It doesn’t necessarily mean it is easier but definitely shorter, yes.

Now let’s examine the 4 sections of IELTS vs. TOEFL and compare the two.

Factor 3
Reading Sections?
Duration of the Reading Sections

In the TOEFL, the Reading section lasts anywhere between 60 minutes to 100 minutes. Some students are given a shorter version of the test and some longer.

You have no control over that.

If you have the shorter version, you will get 3 passages and for each, you have 20 minutes. So the shortest you could take is 60 minutes.
The longest you could get is 5 passages and each for 20 minutes. Hence, the longest running time for this section is 100 minutes.
That’s right. You have no control over the number of passages so you cannot do anything about the duration of the Reading section of the TOEFL.

The Reading section of the IELTS is always the same length for everyone with 3 passages and 20 minutes for each so everyone gets 60 minutes for the entire length of the Reading section in the IELTS.

In terms of the types of questions

The level of English for both tests is the same. It is academic.

TOEFL
In the TOEFL, all the passages in this section are of the same difficulty level.
All questions in the TOEFL Reading section are of Multiple Choice Type with 4 options with each question.
You don’t have to write anything or pick any word from the passage, just choose from the options given to a question.
IELTS
In the IELTS, the difficulty level changes as you progress through questions and it is computer-adaptive which means your answers will decide the difficulty level.
The computer adapts to your rhythm of answering and poses more difficult questions if you get the previous ones correct and less difficult questions if the preceding ones are incorrect.
There are about 10-12 questions after each text.
In the IETLS however, you can have all types of questions in the Reading section.
There are Multiple Choice Questions types, True False Not Given types (TNFG), etc.
For some, you have to actually choose words from the passage to answer questions. Some students find this difficult and so the more you practice, the better it is.

Factor 4

Listening Sections?
The Listening sections are quite different in the TOEFL and the IETLS.
Duration of Listening Sections
The TOEFL Listening sections are about 40 to 60 minutes long. In the IELTS, it is about 30 minutes, i.e. half an hour.
So, IELTS Listening sections are shorter but it’s different in terms of the types of questions asked. So shorter doesn’t always mean easier, remember that.
You have to try out and see what works for you.
Question types – TOEFL
The TOEFL Listening section consists of campus conversations and academic lectures.
In all cases of the TOEFL recordings, you listen, you take notes, and after that, you see the questions and answer them accordingly.
All of the questions here are multiple-choice types and you have to choose the right answer.
The accents in the recordings are generally American or Canadian.
Question types – IELTS

In the IELTS however, it is completely different.

You listen to the passages and you write the answers as you go along.
In some cases, you are filling in blanks.
In some other cases, you are matching terms or filling out a chart or as in some cases, you may have multiple choice options and choose from them.
There are a variety of different types of questions in the Listening passages of the IETLS.
Again, all the accents in the IELTS are British or Australian mostly.

GET THE COMPLETE GUIDANCE TO STUDY ABROAD

Factor 5
Speaking Sections?
Again, the Speaking sections are also quite different in IELTS vs. TOEFL.
TOEFL
The Speaking section in the TOEFL consists of you sitting facing a computer with headphones on, which are attached to a microphone.
You are asked to record your answer to 6 different kinds of task types that are given to you.
You have to speak for 45 seconds in some cases.
The longest you have to speak for in any of the tasks is 60 seconds.
So, you have 6 tasks in total for the TOEFL Speaking section, all of which are recorded.
This entire section may last for about 20 minutes.
IELTS

For the IETLS, it is a completely different picture.

In the IELTS Speaking section, you will be sitting with a human examiner. You will face something like an interview with this examiner. This entire section will last for about 11-14 minutes.

IELTS Speaking section has 3 stages.

Every test is recorded.

Stage 1 – Introduction & interview

In this part, the examiner introduces him/herself and checks your identity. They will then ask you general questions on some familiar topics such as home, family, work, education, and your interests. To ensure consistency, questions will be taken from a script.

Questions like where are you from, what’s your name, what do you do, what do you like, what are your hobbies and things like that are asked.

You may be asked about your hobbies, reasons for taking IELTS exam as well as other general topics such as clothing, free time, computers and the internet or family.

IELTS vs. TOEFL: IELTS Speaking Part 1

Stage 2 – Long turn

Part 2 is the individual long turn. The examiner will give you a task card that asks you to talk about a particular topic, includes points to cover in your talk and instructs you to explain one aspect of the topic. This shall be a monologue where you are the speaker.

You are given 1 minute to prepare your talk and are given a pencil and paper to make notes. The examiner will ask you to talk for 1 to 2 minutes, will stop you after 2 minutes, and will ask1 or 2 questions on the same topic.

IELTS vs. TOEFL: IELTS Speaking Part 2

Stage 3 – Discussion

In Part 3, the examiner will discuss with you issues related to the topic you were given in Part 2, in a more general and abstract way and also in greater depth.

This part of the test focuses on your ability to express and justify opinions and to analyze, discuss and speculate about issues.

This 3rd part involves a discussion between the examiner and you, generally on questions relating to the theme that they have already spoken about in section 2. This last section is more abstract and is typically considered the most difficult.

IELTS vs. TOEFL: IELTS Speaking Part 2

Factor 6
Writing Sections?
Writing sections of IELTS vs. TOEFL have some common elements and some differences.

The common element is that in the TOEFL and IELTS, you have to write an essay. There are 2 tasks in this section for both TOEFL and IELTS.

In the TOEFL Writing Task 1, you have to write a 5 paragraph essay. You have about half an hour to write about 300-350 words. You have only one topic and you have to write on that topic.

In the IELTS Writing Task 1, you also have to write one essay on a topic given to you. This will be at least about 250 words (any less would be penalizing) and you have 40 minutes. So yes, you have a longer time to write. So that part is a little easier. Your essay will be about 4-5 paragraphs in length for the IETLS Writing Task 1.

The second task is quite different for TOEFL and IETLS Writing Sections

In the TOEFL:

Task 2 is an integrated task. What does that mean? Integrated means various skills are tested together.

First, you are given a short passage of about 3 paragraphs to read. It is usually something academic from a textbook. You read that for about 3 minutes and then you listen to a lecture about the same topic.

Now, the lecture may support the reading or may contradict the reading. It depends. You have to take notes, which is very very essential in this part without which you will have nothing to write about.

The last thing you have to do is to answer the question they ask you integrating information from the reading passage and the listening portion (notes specifically) into a response of about 150-225 words.

In the IELTS:

The IELTS Writing Task 2 gives you a table or a graph or a chart, and you are asked to describe the information that is given in that item.

IELTS Writing Task 2 needs a certain kind of preparation to know exactly the vocabulary of movements, of graphs or how to describe trends etc.

TOEFL vs. IELTS: Comparing Their Scores and Marking Schemes

A key element in your admissions process is your English-language proficiency test scores.

There was a time when it was only TOEFL in this segment, now it faces stiff competition from the IELTS.
One thing common among is that they measure your ability as a non-native speaker to speak, write, read and hear the English language.

TOEFL will rate you on a range from 0-120 and the IELTS uses a rating scale of 1 to 9. The higher the test score, of course, the better it is. However, there is a certain figure that can push up your chances of getting accepted into the program of your choice. Check on this with the university or institute you are planning to apply. All these scores are valid for two years.

The figure here shows a comparison between total TOEFL scores and overall IELTS band scores.

For USA/UK, Which is Better TOEFL or IELTS?

It totally depends on what test your university or institution is seeking. Some universities as Harvard Business School, INSEAD, Yale etc. make it difficult when they state that they accept any one of the two.

It is commonly believed by most ex-test takers and experts that the IELTS score is better accepted in Europe which includes the UK and Australia. The TOEFL sees better reception from the institutes in America.

TOEFL vs. IELTS: Recommendations from us

IELTS has two versions: IELTS Academic and IELTS General. (restating the versions, if you’ve missed this earlier in the post)

Now, remember, the General IELTS Test is considered easier (to both IELTS Academic and TOEFL), as the General IELTS Reading and General IELTS Writing sections are simpler than both IELTS Academic and TOEFL. The other 2 components, Listening and Speaking, are the same for both the formats of IELTS Academic and IELTS General.

For the General IELTS module, the writing task, you only have to write an essay and a letter. The reading passages also are a little bit easier.

If given a choice to pick out of TOEFL and IELTS General Test, by all means, go for the latter for obvious reasons and higher chances at a better score. TOEFL is an academic exam and so is the IELTS Academic module. The General IELTS module is easier than both TOEFL and Academic IELTS.

However, if you have to choose between the TOEFL and IELTS Academic:

You’re really going to have to decide on this one based on all the factors we’ve discussed above and you’re level of comfort with any particular question format. This means you need to understand how the two differ before selecting which test to study for and ultimately take. TOEFL and IELTS are different in their structure, approach, and answering criteria.

There are pros and cons for both and that depends on the test-taker really. Pros for someone and cons for another!
IELTS is shorter, basis the length of some of the sections but not implicitly easier. Each student responds in a different way.

The best advice that we have really is

Do a sample of both types and compare your results first. See which one you have the greatest difficulty with.
There are different types of questions in each, with responses required in different ways. Some students have more difficulty with one exam rather than with the other.

Don’t think the TOEFL is necessarily harder because it’s longer. There are more multiple-choice questions so some students still find it easier.

Also, another factor to bear in mind is that the Listening section (Factor 4 above) of the IELTS requires you to write in the answers and spellings matter. So if you’re weak with spellings, this is another thing that you want to keep in mind. Plus, IELTS is more of UK/ Australian English. Whereas the Listening section in TOEFL has just multiple choice type questions, so spellings don’t count, okay?

Another small point, before we wind up, is that the TOEFL Writing section (Factor 6 above) has to be written on the computer. Everything is about you and the computer there.

Whereas, the IELTS Writing section requires you to write out physically, remember that. So if for some reason, you’re not comfortable with keyboarding (typing), your typing skills are not very good or fast or efficient (typing is mandatory in TOEFL), then you might prefer the IELTS because you get to write out this section.

So students choose IELTS over TOEFL or vice-versa for a variety of reasons. So please practice tryouts, sample tests and consult guidebooks to see which format you’re more comfortable with. No matter what age you belong to, every test-taker will prefer the easier format but the definition of ‘easier’ is different for each one of us, right?

Which is better TOEFL or IELTS for you?

As mentioned earlier, if you are planning on studying in the UK, you have no choice but to take the IELTS.
But if you are planning on applying to institutes in Canada, Australia, or America, you have a choice to make because universities in those countries accept both.

To keep it simple, if you are more comfortable with multiple choice questions and if you find speaking into a microphone easier, as well as if you wish to apply to an institute in the US, then the TOEFL is better suited for you.

If you feel better suited to talking to a person rather than into a microphone, and if you are comfortable with confronting a variety of different question types during the exam, then the IELTS is better for you.

It will be helpful to take a practice exam before you begin studying so that you can assess your baseline.
It’s really a combination of factors involved.

TOEFL and IELTS: How to prepare for them?

It will be helpful to take a practice exam before you begin studying so that you can assess your baseline.

Practice tests

Always use TOEFL or IELTS practice tests made by the same people who actually created the real ones.
Some IELTS or TOEFL practice tests are shoddy. These are typically made by those not bothered about carefully replicating the real exam.

Find materials that carefully recreate the “real feat.” Especially those made by reputable companies

Take practice tests throughout your studying. You can consistently assess your skills and observe how you are escalating.

Find preparation material

How do you find a good test? How to find a test that will accurately measure your baseline? One way is to look online for guides and find good TOEFL and IELTS sample tests. Another way is to trust us.

Your baseline tells you how much you need to improve your overall score.

It also tells you which sections are the hardest for you.

Consider these difficult areas as your target areas. These are the parts that you need to target for extra emphasis.

Register for test day

Choosing the right test date is an important thing.

Setting a date is far more than just making your TOEFL and IELTS plans official. Your test date determines how much time you have to prepare.

Remember you need to get your official score report in time for application deadlines so your choice of test day must also allow you to do just that.

Choosing a test date puts your target in sight. It also ensures a solid deadline that you can work with.

In Canada, the topic of doctor salaries has long been a subject of interest and debate. As one of the most crucial pillars of the healthcare system, doctors play a vital role in providing essential medical services to the population. However, understanding the complexities of doctor salaries in Canada requires delving into various factors that shape their remuneration. A significant aspect that influences the earning potential of doctors is the province or territory in which they practice. Canada’s healthcare system is decentralized, resulting in differing compensation structures and fee schedules across the country. Furthermore, the specialization and experience of a physician also impact their income.

Highly specialized fields, such as neurosurgery or cardiology, often command higher salaries compared to general practitioners. Additionally, factors like geographical location, population density, and demand for specific medical services contribute to the salary differentials among doctors. Moreover, the fee-for-service model prevalent in many provinces, where doctors are compensated based on the number and type of services rendered, adds another layer of complexity to the salary equation. Understanding the intricacies of doctor salaries in Canada requires examining these multifaceted factors, as well as considering the broader context of healthcare funding and the pursuit of equitable compensation for healthcare professionals across the country.

Steps to Become a Doctor in Canada

Studying in Canada and especially MBBS is one of the most-sought choices among students worldwide. Pursuing an MBBS degree from Canada opens the door to limitless possibilities and placement opportunities. Becoming a doctor anywhere in the world required precision, hard work, dedication, and significant financial backing.

The steps involved in becoming a doctor in Canada involve:

Pursuing a Bachelor’s Degree

The first step is to complete a bachelor’s degree from a recognized university. While there is no specific pre-medical program in Canada, it is common for aspiring doctors to pursue a degree in a science-related field such as biology, chemistry, or physiology.

Attempt the Medical College Admission Test (MCAT)

The MCAT is a standardized exam that assesses critical thinking, problem-solving, and knowledge of scientific concepts. Most Canadian medical schools require applicants to take the MCAT, and a good score is crucial for acceptance.

Note: The National Eligibility Entrance Test (NEET) with minimum marks is mandatory for Indian students who want to study medicine in Canada.

Applying to a Medical School

After completing the bachelor’s degree and obtaining the MCAT scores, aspiring doctors must apply to medical schools. In Canada, there are 17 medical schools, and each has its own admission requirements and application process.

Complete a Medical Degree

Once accepted into medical school, students embark on a rigorous four-year program. The curriculum consists of a combination of classroom-based learning, laboratory work, and clinical rotations. Students pick up information and experience in a variety of medical areas.

Cracking the Medical Council of Canada Evaluating Examination (MCCEE)

Near the end of medical school, students must pass the MCCEE, a comprehensive exam that assesses the knowledge and skills necessary for entry into supervised practice.

Complete Residency Training

After graduating from medical school, doctors must undertake residency training in a specific specialty or discipline. Residency programs typically last from two to seven years, depending on the chosen specialty. During residency, doctors work under the supervision of experienced physicians and gain hands-on clinical experience.

Attempt the Medical Council of Canada Qualifying Examination

Upon completing residency, doctors must pass the MCCQE Part I and Part II exams. These exams evaluate the clinical skills and knowledge required to practice medicine independently in Canada.

Request License

Once all the necessary exams have been passed, doctors can apply for licensure with the provincial or territorial regulatory authority where they intend to practice. Each province or territory has its own licensing requirements, which may include additional exams or assessments.

It’s important to note that the process of becoming a doctor in Canada may vary slightly depending on the province or territory. It is advisable for aspiring doctors to research the specific requirements of the medical schools and regulatory authorities in the region they wish to practice.

Salary of an MBBS Doctor in Canada

MBBS is considered to be one of the best courses to study in Canada. The salary of an MBBS doctor in Canada can vary depending on several factors such as experience, specialization, location, and type of employment. In Canada, the MBBS degree is equivalent to an MD (Doctor of Medicine) degree.

On average, a newly graduated MBBS doctor in Canada can expect to earn a salary of around $160,000 per year. However, as doctors gain more experience and specialize in a specific field, their salaries increase significantly.

Steps to Become a Doctor in Australia

Becoming a doctor in Australia involves several years of rigorous education, training, and certification. Here are the steps to becoming a doctor in Australia:

Obtain a Bachelor’s Degree
Take the GAMSAT
Apply to Medical School
Complete the MD Program
Complete an internship
Enroll with the Medical Board of Australia
Complete a Residency
Obtain Certification from the Australian Medical Council

Let’s have a look at each step one by one below:

Step 1: Obtain a Bachelor’s Degree

To start your journey toward becoming a doctor in Australia, you will need to obtain a Bachelor’s degree from a recognized institution. While there are no specific undergraduate degrees required, it is recommended to complete a degree in a field related to medicine, such as biology or health sciences. However, students who hold a degree in other fields can also apply to medical schools as long as they have completed the required prerequisite courses in sciences.

Step 2: Take the GAMSAT

After obtaining a Bachelor’s degree, the next step is to take the Graduate Australian Medical School Admissions Test (GAMSAT). This test is designed to assess the aptitude and knowledge of the candidates applying for medical school. The test consists of three sections: reasoning in humanities and social sciences, written communication, and reasoning in biological and physical sciences.

Step 3: Apply to Medical School

Once you have taken the GAMSAT, you can then apply to medical school. Several medical schools in Australia offer a Doctor of Medicine (MD) degree, which is a four-year program. The admission process varies from one school to another, but most medical schools require a high GPA and a good GAMSAT score. It’s important to research and apply to schools that match your interests and qualifications.

Step 4: Complete the MD Program

During the four-year MD program, you will learn the essential knowledge and skills required to become a doctor. The first two years will focus on the foundational knowledge of medical sciences such as anatomy, physiology, and pharmacology. The final two years will be focused on clinical rotations, where you will have the opportunity to gain hands-on experience and apply your knowledge in real-world settings.

Step 5: Complete an internship

After completing the MD program, you will need to complete a one-year internship in a hospital or clinical setting. During this internship, you will work under the supervision of licensed medical professionals to gain the practical experience and skills required to work as a doctor.

Step 6: Enroll with the Medical Board of Australia

To practice as a doctor in Australia, you must be registered with the Medical Board of Australia. This registration process involves meeting specific standards, including English language proficiency and completion of medical qualifications from an accredited institution. You will also need to pass a criminal history check and provide evidence of professional indemnity insurance.

Step 7: Complete a Residency

After completing the internship and registering with the Medical Board of Australia, you will need to complete a residency program. A residency program is a supervised training program that provides further education and experience in a specific area of medicine. The length of the residency program varies from one to six years, depending on the specialty.

Step 8: Obtain Certification from the Australian Medical Council

The final step to becoming a doctor in Australia is obtaining certification from the Australian Medical Council (AMC). The AMC certification ensures that you have met the required standards for medical practice in Australia. This certification is necessary to practice as a specialist in a specific area of medicine.

Now that you know how to check IELTS results, let’s understand…

Format of IELTS Result

The IELTS result consists of scores for four skills and an overall score, ranging from 1 to 9. The average of the overall four skill scores is rounded to the nearest half-band. For example, if a candidate scores 7 in Listening, 6.5 in Reading, 8 in Writing, and 7.5 in Speaking, their overall score would be 7.

Each score level is accompanied by a description of the candidate’s language ability. For instance, a score of 7 in Speaking indicates “good user” ability, meaning the candidate has a generally effective command of the language despite some inaccuracies, inappropriate usage, and misunderstandings.

The IELTS result also includes a Test Report Form (TRF) containing the candidate’s personal details, test date, test center, and whether they took the Academic or General Training version of the test.

Recognized by over 10,000 organizations worldwide, including educational institutions, employers, and immigration authorities, the IELTS result holds significant value. Typically, a score of 7 or above is considered good, although specific requirements may vary depending on the organization.

The IELTS result provides a comprehensive evaluation of a candidate’s English language proficiency, serving as a valuable tool for academic, career, and international opportunities.

Re-marking of IELTS result

If a candidate is not satisfied with their IELTS result, they have the option to request a re-marking of their test. This process is also known as an Enquiry on Results (EOR).

To request a re-marking, the candidate must apply within six weeks of the test date. The application must include the candidate’s TRF and payment for the re-marking fee, which varies by country.

Once the application is received, the IELTS test center will send the candidate’s test materials to the IELTS central office for re-marking. The re-marking is carried out by trained examiners who are not aware of the candidate’s original score.

During the re-marking process, the candidate’s test materials are assessed by a different examiner than the one who originally graded the test. The examiner will review the candidate’s responses and score them according to the IELTS marking criteria.

If the re-marking results in a higher score, the candidate will be issued a new TRF and the re-marking fee will be refunded. If the re-marking does not result in a higher score, the original score will stand and the re-marking fee will not be refunded.

It is important to note that requesting a re-marking does not guarantee a higher score, as the original score may be confirmed or even lowered. Therefore, candidates should carefully consider whether a re-marking is necessary and weigh the potential risks and benefits before applying.

Take the MCAT: The Medical College Admission Test (MCAT) is a standardized test that assesses a student’s knowledge and skills in areas such as biology, chemistry, and physics. It’s a crucial step in the medical school admission process.
Attend Medical School: After completing a Bachelor’s degree and the MCAT, the next step is to attend medical school. Medical school typically takes four years to complete, and students study subjects such as anatomy, physiology, pharmacology, and medical ethics.
Complete Residency Training: After graduating from medical school, doctors must complete residency training in their chosen specialty. Residency typically takes three to seven years, depending on the specialty.
Obtain Medical Licensure: To practice medicine in the USA, doctors must obtain a medical license. Requirements for medical licensure vary by state but typically involve passing a licensing exam and meeting other requirements such as background checks and continuing education.

However, it’s important to note that these are just averages, and salaries can vary widely based on various factors. Factors such as location, specialty, and experience can significantly impact a doctor’s salary. For example, doctors in metropolitan areas tend to earn higher salaries than those in rural areas, and specialties such as cardiology and neurosurgery tend to offer higher pay compared to fields like family medicine and pediatrics.

Canada Permanent Residency (PR) Visa is a document that allows an individual to live, work, and study in Canada indefinitely. The PR visa holder has almost all the same rights and privileges as a Canadian citizen, including access to healthcare, education, and social services.

To apply for a Canada PR visa, you must first determine your eligibility for one of Canada’s immigration programs. The most common programs are:

Provincial Nominee Program (PNP): Allows provinces/territories to nominate PR candidates based on labor market needs.
Family Sponsorship: Allows citizens/PRs to sponsor family members to live in Canada.

Once you determine which program you are eligible for, you will need to submit an application and all required documents. Canadian authorities will review your application and determine your eligibility for PR. They will make the final decision on your application.

If your application is approved, you will receive a Confirmation of Permanent Residence (COPR) and a Permanent Resident Visa (PRV). Arrive in Canada before PRV expiry and show COPR to the immigration officer at the port of entry. Once you enter Canada, you will officially become a permanent resident of Canada.

How to get PR in Canada?

Getting permanent residency (PR) in Canada is a multi-step process that requires meeting specific eligibility criteria, submitting documentation, and passing background checks.

Create an Express Entry profile: To enter the pool of candidates for permanent residency, eligible applicants for the Federal Skilled Worker Program, the Canadian Experience Class, or the Federal Skilled Trades Program must create an Express Entry profile.
Receive an Invitation to Apply (ITA): If you meet the minimum requirements for a specific immigration program and have a high enough Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) score, you may receive an ITA to apply for PR.

Online v/s offline course

Both on-campus and online business management courses in Canada offer benefits and drawbacks. Offline courses, usually referred to as conventional classroom-based courses, give learners the chance to communicate with teachers and peers in person. Students who study better in a structured atmosphere and who value the social aspects of attending lessons may find this to be advantageous.

Online courses, on the other hand, give students greater freedom and convenience since they let them study at their own speed and according to their own schedule. Students who work or have other responsibilities may particularly benefit from this. Students who reside in rural places or find it difficult to get to class in person may find online courses to be more economical and accessible.
However, the decision between online and offline courses will ultimately come down to the interests and circumstances of each individual student.

Accreditation

In Canada, business management courses can be accredited by various organizations, such as:

The Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB)
The Accreditation Council for Business Schools and Programs (ACBSP)
The Canadian Association of Management Consultants (CAMC)

Accreditation is a voluntary process that evaluates the quality of education and training provided by a business school or program. Accreditation ensures that a school or program meets certain standards of academic excellence, faculty qualifications, and student outcomes.

The GRE subject test program assesses the candidate’s knowledge in specific areas such as chemistry, psychology, mathematics, and others. Both the GRE tests use different criteria to measure a candidate’s qualifications. The GRE General Test is scored on a 130-170 scale, while the Subject Tests are scored on a 200-990 scale.

Highlights of the GRE Exam

The GRE seems more difficult than the ACT or SAT because the questions are designed for candidates who have completed an undergraduate degree. The purpose of taking the GRE is to test a candidate’s level of academic performance in undergraduate subjects.

A few points to keep in mind before taking the GRE:

Whether your chosen course requires the GRE or other tests like the ACT
Are there any merit-based applicant scholarships or GRE scholarships to fund the course program?
Have you been shortlisted for a course or Ph.D.?
Can I apply for further study based on my graduate GPA?

If you believe that a good GRE score is a myth, you need to do a detailed analysis and comparison of the graduate schools you dream of attending. The quantitative and verbal sections of the exam are scored in the range of 130-170. The average GRE Verbal Reasoning score is 151 and the GRE Quantitative Reasoning score is 154. Applicants may take the exam a maximum of 5 times per year. The GRE score is valid for 5 years.

According to the Canadian constitution, education is a provincial responsibility, which means that there are significant differences between the education systems of different provinces. However, education is important to Canadians, and standards across the country are equally high. The education system in Canada includes both public and private schools, including community colleges/technical institutes, vocational colleges, language schools, secondary schools, summer camps, universities, and university colleges.

Canada’s education system includes private and public schools, including language schools, summer camps, community colleges, technical institutes, high schools, career institutes, universities, and colleges.

Because the education system is under the control of the central government, the standard of education in Canada is constantly set at a higher level than in the whole country. The well-managed education system in the province has been strengthened day by day and has gained immense popularity among foreign students.

Do you know?

The Canadian central government spends approximately 6% of its GDP on education, meaning that institutions from kindergarten to high school fall under the government.

Domestic children aged 4 to 5 voluntarily attend kindergarten for 1-2 years. Their classes start at around 6 years old. Depending on the region, secondary schools go up to the 11th or 12th grade. After all these classes, they go to college or university. When choosing a school or educational institution in Canada, a student should consider the size, type, and location of the particular institution.

To make it easier for you, we have created a quick guide to everything you need to know about the Canada Education System:

Overview of Canada’s Education system

The education system in Canada for immigrants is the same as it is for citizens. Children have to get schooling till 16 years of age compulsorily. It is divided into four segments-:

Pre-Elementary Level

Kindergarten or the pre-elementary category is the first educational stage in the country. It is available for children between four and five years before commencing elementary education. It is compulsory in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, while it is optional in all other regions. It is offered across private, public, and federal schools in Canada and the first year is mostly free. Some provinces even provide extra years without any charges. Quebec, for instance, provides kindergarten education at zero costs for people from lower-income backgrounds or even for specially-abled kids. Children enjoy a more satisfying educational curriculum while learning basics like counting, art, reading, playing with peers, music, reading, etc.

Primary Level

Primary education in Canada is compulsory for kids, right from Grade 1 onwards. It is usually at six-seven years and goes on till Grade 6 (when the children are11-12 years old). There is one teacher who instructs them on all the subjects at this level. Special classes are also provided upon request. The pre-elementary stage has subjects like Mathematics, Reading, Science, History, English Language or French (in provinces like Quebec), Social Studies, Music, Art, and Physical Education.

Secondary Level

Secondary Canadian education comes with junior high school and high school sub-categories. The former is two years, comprising Grades 7 and 8. Students gradually adjust to changing teachers and classrooms while preparing for the advanced level of difficulty. The high school covers four years until Grades 11 or 12 or 16-18 years, depending upon the province and other factors. Students should compulsorily remain till 16 years of age in school. The law in New Brunswick and Ontario states that they should study until 18 when they get high-school diplomas. Quebec mandates secondary education till Grade 11, and this is followed by the CEGEP (publicly funded college, exclusive to Quebec) or the two-year pre-university curriculum.

Post-Secondary Level

After high-school graduation, Canadians can start applying to universities and colleges. Colleges in the country are majorly trade schools or community colleges which are smaller. Many Canadian students go to college as a means of preparation for university studies. They also get credits that are transferable to their university programs. Universities offer higher education to Canadians with diverse subjects, courses, and academic degrees on offer. The structure is similar to the US, beginning with a UG degree, followed by a postgraduate course, and culminating with a Ph.D. qualification. In the case of public colleges and universities, they receive provincial government sponsorship. The remainder is covered by research grants, federal government sponsorship, and nominal tuition fees from students.

Types of education loans available

Both private and public banks as well as NBFCs provide education loans in Canada. You can choose from two types –

Let’s discuss it in detail:

Secured loan in Canada

This type of student loan in Canada requires the applicant to provide some collateral as security. Collateral here is pledged to the lender as security equal to the loan amount. The collateral for such an education loan for Canada is:

Tangible assets such as land (non-agricultural), houses, flats, or any similar facilities.
Intangible assets like life insurance, fixed deposits, government bonds, etc.

Public sector banks in India mostly provide secured loans for education in Canada. The maximum loan amount granted under the educational scheme of the state bank depends on the value of the collateral.

Loan without collateral in Canada

Here, applicants do not require a lender’s collateral to avail of the loan. But there must be a co-applicant whose income determines the likelihood of a loan sanction. If you are looking for a student loan for Canada in India, keep in mind that only private lenders and a few international ones offer unsecured student loans. Unsecured education loans are mainly provided by NBFCs and private banks like ICICI Bank, Axis Bank, etc.

Eligibility requirements

Different banks have different eligibility criteria for studying in Canada. For example, some banks may make it mandatory to have a co-signer, while others may have collateral guidelines. Knowing the bank’s eligibility criteria will help you determine how likely you are to get a loan from them.

However, there are some important criteria that you must meet to get a loan from any bank. These include –

Citizenship – Applicant must be a citizen of India
Age – Applicant must be over 18 years of age (or parents must apply for the loan)
Admission – Applicant must be admitted to a recognized Canadian university/college
Program – Preference is given to technical and vocational courses
Academic Record – Applicant must have an excellent academic record

**Pro tip – It’s also good to know some of the common reasons financial institutions deny loans.

Under the following circumstances, the bank may reject your loan application:

The applicant’s or co-applicant’s income may not be able to cover the interest payable during the training period.
The applicant or co-applicant has a low CIBIL score.
The applicant has applied for a non-STEM course (or a course with poor employability prospects).
All necessary documents related to the pledge have not been submitted.
Documents required for education loan

Over the past few years, the number of Indian students going abroad to study has increased exponentially, so the demand for loans has also increased significantly. To sanction the loan, banks also check the details provided by the applicants. Thus, there is a list of documents that the applicant must submit to the bank. Here is a list of documents required to apply for a student loan:

Letter of Admission from University/Institute (Confirmation of Admission)
Loan application form
Passport size photos
Academic documents (certificates and grades)
Qualification exam papers (e.g., GMAT, IELTS)
Certificate of residence of the student and guarantor
Statements from borrowers’ bank accounts (for the last year)
Certificate of guarantor’s income

Note: Document requirements may vary depending on the bank’s rules and regulations, so it is always recommended to check the list of required documents with the respective bank.
How to apply for a loan?

Getting a loan sanction is not only tedious but also time-consuming, so to avoid the rush at the last minute, you should always start applying for a loan early. By receiving a letter from the university, students get an idea of ​​the total costs, including tuition and accommodation. Calculate the amount you need to finance and how much you are going to spend out of pocket. Before you apply for a loan, do your research and check which banks offer the best loan deals. Also, check how to choose a bank for a study abroad loan.

Compare loan offers from different banks according to the following parameters:

Interest rate
Processing fee
Expenses covered under education loan for abroad studies
Loan processing time
Prepayment terms and duration

After choosing a bank, fill out the application form and familiarize yourself with the bank’s requirements. Inability to show sufficient funds can also lead to rejection, so it is always recommended to apply to at least two or three banks for loans.

Conclusion

You can repay your education loan in Canada at any time during your academic courses or 6 months after your studies have ended. If you manage to repay it in full before the end of the course, the respective banks will not charge you any interest. At the end of the grace period (6 months), students receive documents from the government detailing the interest rate and repayment amount. In the case of a student line of credit from CIBC, the line of credit turns into a personal loan one year after graduation. Students also have the option to extend the repayment period up to a maximum of 20 years.

Students often opt for an education loan in Canada to finance their studies. Education loans are a great resource for many who want to pursue higher education and make their dreams of studying abroad a reality.

Originally called the Scholastic Aptitude Test, then the Scholastic Assessment Test, and now commonly referred to as the SAT, the exam is administered to students for admission to colleges/universities abroad. The College Board, which is the official administering agency for the SAT, has not established any specific SAT eligibility criteria for students taking one of the most prominent undergraduate admissions tests abroad.

The SAT test evaluates the verbal, mathematical, and writing skills of people who want to enter undergraduate programs at top universities. Those interested in studying in the United States and Canada are especially eligible to take this exam. However, universities in New Zealand, Australia, the UK, and Singapore also accept SAT scores.

To make it easier for you, we have created a quick guide to everything you need to know about SAT exam eligibility.

SAT Exam Eligibility for Indian Students

To study abroad in developed countries, passing the SAT exam is very important. This is why it is important to understand the eligibility criteria, especially eligibility for Indian students for the SAT exam. While there are no fixed eligibility criteria for the SAT, there are certain parameters that one should be aware of before applying for the exam. Some of these include:

Age limit
Educational background
Students with Disabilities
ID Proof
Photo

We will elaborate on everything for you in this blog. Stay with us till the end to have answers to all your questions.

Age Limits for the SAT Exam

Generally, 10th and 11th-standard candidates take the SAT as determined by the College Board and the age of applicants is usually around 17-19 years.

The College Board’s statement contains the following rules regarding the age levels of candidates who can take the SAT:

Students under the age of 13 can register by phone or mail only. Due to online privacy restrictions, students under this age cannot apply online. In addition, students who applied by phone have the right to opt-out.
Non-9th-grade students do not need to submit a photograph with registration but must present a valid photo ID to the exam center.
Students over the age of 21 must bring a valid government-issued photo ID to their exam center.

Education Level Requirements

The College Board has not established minimum educational requirements. Individuals do not necessarily need a 10+2 certificate to apply for SAT. Therefore, Indian students who are currently in high school can apply for the SAT exam. However, if the goal is to enroll in undergraduate programs, having a high school diploma is essential. Although it is not mandatory, a good command of English can help candidates a lot. This is because the language of instruction in the test is English. High school has no minimum score requirements to apply for the SAT.

Key Points to consider

Here are some points you should consider:

Basic computer skills: The SAT is taken on a computer and students should be familiar with basic computer skills such as using a mouse and keyboard.
Basic high school level knowledge: The SAT exam assesses knowledge acquired during the high school years in areas such as mathematics, critical reading, and writing.
Critical reading and writing skills: The critical reading and writing sections test a student’s ability to understand and analyze written materials, including informational graphics and passages.
English proficiency: Strong English proficiency is important for the critical reading and writing sections, as students are expected to demonstrate mastery of the English language.
Math skills: The math section of the SAT covers basic arithmetic, algebra, geometry, and trigonometry.
Preparation resources: Preparation for the SAT can be done through online resources such as Khan Academy, as well as through textbooks, practice tests, and tutors.
Standardized test experience: Familiarity with standardized tests and test-taking conditions can also be helpful in preparing for the SAT.
Test-taking strategies: Preparation for the SAT should also include learning test-taking strategies, such as time management and managing anxiety.
Practice, practice, practice: Finally, the key to success on the SAT is practice. Students should take multiple practice tests to familiarize themselves with the format and content of the exam.

For example, if you missed the spring intake this year, you can always try the next intake in January instead of waiting a full year. This gives a lot of freedom and opportunity to students who want to study abroad, as they don’t have to wait an entire academic year in case they miss out on a certain intake.

What is a study abroad intake?

Studying abroad can be a life-changing experience for students, offering a unique opportunity to immerse oneself in a new culture, learn a new language, and gain a new perspective on the world. But for students who are considering studying abroad, one of the most important factors to consider is the study abroad intake schedule.

A study abroad intake refers to the dates when a university or program begins accepting applications for international students. These dates can vary depending on the institution and the program, and students need to research and plan accordingly.

Types of study abroad intake

Here are 3 major types of study abroad intakes:

Fall Intake

Fall intake admission begins in late August – early September and ends in the second half of December. Fall admission is available at almost all universities, including such prestigious ones as MIT, Harvard, Stanford, and others.

It attracts the largest number of applications because the academic years of many high school and undergraduate students end in April, making fall enrollment a popular choice for many students.

More competition and fewer prospects of admission, since there are more applicants for autumn admission. Comparatively speaking, the adoption rate is lower than the spring intake.

Most institutional awards are given on a first-come, first-served basis. For students applying for fall enrollment, the university has additional scholarship funding available.

Summer intake

Summer intake admission is a unique situation that is granted by several universities to a select group of students for certain courses, primarily for diplomas or other summer courses.

There are more opportunities to get an offer because institutions that accept applications for summer enrollment receive fewer applicants.

Spring intake

Spring admission begins in January and ends in early May. You may need to check with top institutions because some may not offer spring admission.

Since fewer students choose spring admission, there is less competition. Because fewer students apply in the spring, the acceptance rate is usually higher than when recruiting in the fall.

Most students enrolled in spring classes plan to work or intern after graduation and need the extra time to gain user experience and find a comfortable routine.

What to consider before applying?

When considering applying for a study abroad program, it is important to research the intake schedule and plan accordingly. Also, consider the following:

Program availability: Not all programs are available during all intake periods. Be sure to research the availability of the program you are interested in.
Deadlines: Be sure to check the application deadlines for your desired program. These can vary depending on the institution and the program.
Financial aid and scholarships: Consider the availability of financial aid and scholarships for the intake period you are interested in.
Personal schedule and preferences: Consider your personal schedule and preferences when choosing an intake period. For example, if you prefer a more traditional academic calendar or if you want to experience different seasons, the fall or spring intake may be a better fit for you.
Your goals: Consider what you want to achieve from your study abroad experience, if you are looking to improve your language skills, you might want to consider a program in a country where that language is spoken. If you want to gain international experience in a specific field, you might want to look for programs that offer internships or other opportunities to gain practical experience.
Cost: cost of living and tuition fees vary depending on the country and the university, consider how you will be able to afford it, and if there is any financial aid or scholarships available.

Note: It’s also important to start the application process early to ensure that everything is in order for a smooth transition. This will give you enough time to gather all the required documents, take language tests if required and make any necessary arrangements for accommodation, transportation, and insurance.

Timeline for study abroad intakes

Below is the expected timeline for study abroad intakes.

Pre-application
Do your research: Start researching different study abroad programs and universities to find the one that best fits your academic and personal goals. Determine the course that best suits based on your strengths and interests. See program length, course offerings, location, tuition, financial aid, and scholarship options, as well as application procedures and deadlines. Keep all research material ready. Start as early as possible, preferably 10-12 months before your intended start date.
Take standardized tests: Almost all universities and colleges require scores from an approved English language proficiency test, such as IELTS. Some programs may also request a GRE, GMAT, or SAT score. Check the scores accepted by the institutions you intend to apply to. Start early by preparing the necessary tests, ideally 9-10 months before the planned start date. Keep some time aside in case you have to retake the exam.

Application Preparation

Shortlist universities: Once you have the points, shortlist universities based on your preferences, budget, and location. Prepare your application by gathering all the documents so that you have everything in place by the deadline. Start 7-8 months before your intended start date.

Admission decision

Receive acceptance letters from institutions that qualify you. Evaluate your options well before responding to acceptance emails. It is a good idea to discuss your options with an international education expert who can help you weigh your options better. Respond to your final acceptance on time, as your interview depends on it. Once you receive your final acceptance from the university, make a well-informed decision after discussing it with your advisor and deposit the minimum amount to confirm your admission. Apply for scholarships (if you’re eligible) and other funding options to ease your finances. Start 3-4 months before your planned start date.

Visa preparation

Collect all the documents and start with the documents. Your consultant will help you with the necessary documentation. Most countries allow you to apply for a visa up to three months before your arrival date. Apply for your visa in time to avoid last-minute delays. Start 2-3 months before your planned start date.

Before departure

Provide health insurance and housing. Book your plane tickets in advance to avoid last-minute hassles. Also, if you’re late, tickets will be more expensive. Get yourself an international debit/credit card to help you survive the early days. Gather all the documents and copies you will need upon arrival. Also, start packing to get ready in time. Start 1-2 months before your planned start date.

While the test is an important factor in the admissions process, it is only one of several factors considered by schools. One question that many students have is what’s GRE score validity? But before that…

Do you know?

The cost of the GRE General Test from India is $13. Effective November 1, 2022, the GRE General Test fee will increase by $15 worldwide. The GRE General Test can be taken on paper or on the computer.

The GRE is a standardized test used by most graduate and business schools in the US and Canada. It is used to determine an applicant’s eligibility for a program. The exam is owned and administered by the Educational Testing Service (ETS). The test is used to measure abstract thinking ability in the areas of analytical writing, mathematics, and vocabulary.

The official answer from the Educational Testing Service (ETS), which administers the GRE, is that scores are valid for five years after the testing year in which you took the exam. For example, if you took the GRE in 2020, your scores would be valid until the end of 2025. However, it is important to note that individual schools may have different policies. So it is always a good idea to check with the schools you are applying to.

Why does the GRE score expire? 

GRE scores expire after a certain period of time because the Educational Testing Service (ETS), which administers the exam, wants to ensure that the scores being used by schools are current and accurately reflect the skills and knowledge of the test taker.

The ETS conducts research on the GRE General Test and GRE Subject Tests on a regular basis in order to ensure that the tests are valid and reliable measures of the skills and knowledge they are intended to assess. As part of this research, the ETS may make changes to the content and structure of the tests. If scores are not regularly refreshed, it may not be clear how well the scores align with the current version of the test.

In addition, it is generally expected that an individual’s skills and knowledge will change over time, particularly if they have completed additional education or have gained relevant experience. By setting a score expiration period, the ETS ensures that schools are able to take into account any changes in an individual’s skills and knowledge when making admissions decisions.

Final words

IELTS Academic Vs General Tests: FAQs
What is academic and general training in IELTS?

The IELTS exam is available to candidates in two options.

IELTS Academic is designed for candidates who wish to apply for higher education or professional registration in countries where English is the main language of communication. The main purpose of the exam is to determine whether the candidate is ready to start teaching or learning English. Countries that widely accept IELTS for study include the US, UK, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.

While, on the other hand, IELTS General Training is for aspirants who want to migrate to New Zealand, Australia, Canada, the USA, and the UK or apply for secondary education, training programs, and work experience in an English-speaking environment. The IELTS General Training test was designed to assess the candidate’s everyday, non-academic English proficiency. Countries use it for immigration purposes, focusing on the candidate’s basic survival skills in a wider social and work environment. Both versions of the IELTS test, the Academic and General Training versions, are important in providing a valid and accurate assessment of candidates’ listening, reading, writing, and speaking language skills. Candidates should be well aware of this.

Difference between academic and general IELTS

In this section, we have tabulated the IELTS general vs Academic test comparison.

Purpose

The IELTS Academic test is designed for people who are planning to study at the undergraduate or postgraduate level at a university where English is the primary language of instruction. It is also commonly required for professional registration in certain fields, such as medicine or nursing. While the IELTS General test is geared toward people who are planning to work or immigrate to an English-speaking country.

Content

The IELTS Academic test consists of four parts: reading, writing, listening, and speaking. The reading and writing sections both focus on academic-style texts and tasks, such as summarizing information, analyzing data, and writing essays. The listening and speaking sections also include academic-style content, such as lectures and discussions. On the other hand, the IELTS General test also consists of four parts: reading, writing, listening, and speaking. However, the content of these sections is more general in nature, with a focus on everyday language and tasks.

Acceptance

The IELTS Academic test is typically accepted by universities as proof of English language proficiency. Similarly, the IELTS General test is not typically accepted by universities for this purpose.

Difficulty

Both versions of the IELTS test are challenging and require a high level of English language proficiency. It is advisable to spend some time preparing for the test by practicing your reading, writing, listening, and speaking skills.

Score Comparison

Both versions of the IELTS test are scored on a scale of 0 to 9. The score is divided into four parts: reading, writing, listening, and speaking. The overall score is the average of the scores for each part, with the exception of the speaking part, which is scored separately. The scores for the IELTS Academic and General tests are not directly comparable, as the tests are designed to evaluate different skills and are intended for different purposes. However, both tests use the same scoring scale and evaluate proficiency in the same four areas: reading, writing, listening and speaking.

IELTS Academic and IELTS General Fee for Indian Students

The International English Language Testing System (IELTS) is a standardized international test that assesses the English language proficiency of non-native speakers.

Applicants must follow the rules and guidelines to ensure that they receive maximum support regarding cancellations, rescheduling, and refunds for their IELTS exam fees. In India, the cost of IELTS Academic and General IELTS is the same at INR 15,500.

Which is easier IELTS General vs. Academic?

It is not accurate to say that one version of the IELTS test is “easier” than the other. As both tests are designed to be challenging and to evaluate a high level of English language proficiency. Both tests consist of four parts: reading, writing, listening and speaking.

The main difference between the IELTS Academic and General tests is the focus on the reading, writing, listening, and speaking sections. The IELTS Academic test is geared towards people who plan to study at the undergraduate or postgraduate level at a university where English is the primary language of instruction.

What is the TOEFL exam?

The TOEFL exam is an English proficiency test for students who plan to study in English-speaking countries. TOEFL scores become an important part of the application process for candidates who wish to study abroad in an English-speaking environment. Many times, the TOEFL requirement may be waived, however, this is entirely at the discretion of the university administration. The TOEFL administering body, ETS (Educational Testing Services), is responsible for the TOEFL test, administers the TOEFL iBT test, and sends each test taker their scorecard.

Do You Know? 

Given the pandemic, the TOEFL test is also available to students from the safety of their homes with the launch of the “TOEFL Home Edition”. ETS has also launched a shorter but no less effective version of the TOEFL test called the TOEFL Essential Test, which is available to students from August 21, 2021. Recently, ETS has also agreed to accept Aadhar cards as part of the student ID card for candidates registering for the TOEFL exam from India.

Students who wish to study abroad can choose from several TOEFL test dates available throughout the year, as well as from various test centers located in major cities, or take the TOEFL iBT Home Edition test remotely at home. Candidates who want to take the TOEFL exam will learn about the most important TOEFL exam topics while reading.

Overview of TOEFL Exam 2023
Types of TOEFL exam 

ETS TOEFL conducts the English proficiency exam in two modes: i.e.) Online Test (TOEFL iBT) and Paper Test (TOEFL PBT).

ETS TOEFL – iBT test

The TOEFL-iBT test is the most preferred type, with more than 90% of students attempting the test in this online format. The TOEFL-iBT test consists of 4 sections: speaking, listening, writing, and reading. Students are encouraged to work through all sections on a computer equipped with a microphone and camera. As the iBT test pattern does not have a separate section to test candidates’ knowledge of grammar, the writing section is monitored in detail.

ETS TOEFL – PBT

The TOEFL PBT is a paper-based English language test. Students located outside of online testing centers may take this test. The TOEFL PBT test format differs significantly from the iBT format in that it also contains a separate essay section. In the listening section, PBT has entries that are shorter than IBT.

TOEFL Eligibility Criteria 

There are no strict eligibility criteria for taking the TOEFL exam. Anyone who wants to take the test can register and pay the necessary fees. However, the TOEFL is primarily intended for non-native speakers of English who are planning to study or work in an English-speaking environment.

If you are planning to take the TOEFL exam, it is important to have a good level of English language proficiency. This means that you should be able to understand spoken and written English at a level that is sufficient to participate in academic or professional activities in an English-speaking environment. You should also be able to speak and write in English at a level that is sufficient to communicate effectively with others.

If you are not sure whether you meet the required level of English language proficiency, you may want to consider taking an English language course or practice test to assess your skills. Many universities and other organizations that require the TOEFL exam offer resources and support for students who are preparing for the test, including practice materials and courses to help them improve their English language skills.

TOEFL Registration 

The process for registering for the TOEFL test depends on the version of the test you are taking and your location.

If you are taking the TOEFL iBT (Internet-Based Test), you can register online on the ETS TOEFL website (www.ets.org/toefl). To register, you will need to create an ETS account and provide some personal information, such as your name, date of birth, and contact information.

Why study MBA in Norway? 

Norway offers a unique student experience and Norwegian higher education institutions welcome applications from qualified students from around the world. Internationalization is a priority in all sectors of the Norwegian education system. Universities and colleges are constantly working to facilitate international students.

Eight reasons why you should study in Norway

Quality education

With a wide range of high-quality courses and great flexibility, Norwegian institutions have proven to be an ideal place to study. From vocational subjects to postgraduate studies, there are many opportunities for both exchange and degree-seeking students to realize their ambitions.

Close and equal student-teacher relationship

The “open door” policy of professors, teachers, and administrative staff in Norwegian educational institutions is well known. They are both available and accessible to students to arrange the maximum learning outcome for their students.

Critical thinking is encouraged

In the Norwegian classroom, professors expect graduate students to question their teaching and existing theories in their field of study. The ability to approach a problem differently and critical thinking are valued skills.

Time to specialize

In most cases, master’s programs offered at Norwegian educational institutions last for more than 2 years. This allows students to work on their thesis for a full year, meaning that students get the chance to delve deeper into their area of ​​research.

Most universities offer free education

The Norwegian government considers access to high-quality higher education for all to be an important part of Norwegian society and provides the higher education sector with extensive resources. Therefore, in most universities, international students do not pay tuition fees.

Eligibility criteria for MBA in Norway

Eligibility criteria depend on the university a student is applying to, but as far as we researched, there are some common points that all universities follow, which are listed below.

An applicant for an MBA in Norway must have obtained a bachelor’s degree in any discipline from a recognized board with good grades.
English proficiency certificates such as EILTS or TOEFL are important for admission.
Some universities may also request 3 years or more of administrative or management experience with employer certification.
Also, some colleges may request scorecards for entrance exams, such as the GMAT or GRE. This criterion depends on the university.

Now, here is the most asked question;

Can a student study MBA in Norway without GMAT? 

Applicants must have a bachelor’s degree in business administration or equivalent with at least 120 ECTS in business administration and related subjects. Applicants with a bachelor’s degree from a non-Norwegian/Scandinavian school must have a documented GMAT or GRE test.

Top MBA colleges in Norway

Norway is known for its top MBA colleges. Here are some. These institutes give more breathing space to people who want to truly live a peaceful life in Norway or people who want to work there part-time or on programs. Some available Norwegian colleges for MBA for Indian students:

UiS Business School
University of Agder

Almost all of these colleges offer MBA programs in English for Indian students, however, students should check the specific websites for the respective colleges before applying. Also, tuition is free in these colleges, but students have to apply within a certain deadline.

Cost of studying MBA courses in Norway 

Studying at a university in Norway involves the lowest living costs in Nordic countries. These are housing, books, food, and utilities.

In Norway, students can expect to pay between 800 and 1400 euros per month. In larger cities, average costs may be higher.

Cost of food

You will spend between $284 and $400 per month on food. There are various ways to save money, such as learning how to cook and buying food at a discount. You’ll spend about US$22 at a budget restaurant for dinner for two and up to US$10 for a beer at a mid-range restaurant.

Transport costs

In Norway, students enjoy discounts on public transport with a student card. The transit card costs about $62 a month.

Additional Expenses

MBA Jobs in Norway

After graduating from a Norwegian university or university institution, international students are allowed to stay in Norway for up to a year to look for work.

Please note that you must apply for a residence permit as an applicant before your current permit expires and after you complete your degree.

Compared to many other countries, the Norwegian labor market is characterized by its informality, both in terms of conversation and dress code. After an MBA, you will have many options. As a student, you will have a friendly relationship with your professor and this will carry over to the workplace where you can have lunch with your boss.

In Norway, the official working day is relatively short, with 7.5 hours per day and 37.5 hours per week being the norm. When it comes to working, Norwegians work long hours. We look forward to being able to work a flexible schedule and occasionally work from home. 

The Norwegian labor market offers excellent opportunities for upward social mobility. Women are increasingly taking on leadership roles and policies are in place to encourage and promote gender balance. Working in the private sector on parental leave, for example, is not controversial.

Latest Updates on the TOEFL exam

Since the pandemic, there have been some changes to many standardized tests such as the SAT, GRE, GMAT, and many others. Similarly, there have been some changes in the TOEFL exam.

From July 2021, ETS has allowed Indian students to use Aadhar cards as their ID. This was introduced due to the delay in issuing passports due to the pandemic. Therefore, Indian students are not required to have a passport when registering for the test.
Due to the pandemic, ETS has developed the TOEFL Essentials test for students who are unable to pay the TOEFL exam registration fee. The fee is comparatively low ($100 i.e. INR 7700).

Note: If you want to know an overview of the exam, refer to our TOEFL exam blog post.

TOEFL exam format

ETS offers three types of TOEFL tests: the ETS TOEFL iBT (Internet Test), the ETS TOEFL iBT Home Edition, and the ETS TOEFL Test on Paper. The TOEFL iBT test is the most popular option and is administered at a testing center. The TOEFL iBT Home Edition is the same test, but it is taken from the privacy of your own home and monitored online by a human supervisor. The ETS TOEFL Test on Paper is also similar to the TOEFL iBT test, but it is divided into two sessions. The reading, listening, and writing sections are taken at a test center, while the speaking section is taken at home on your computer and monitored by a human supervisor. The TOEFL PBT (paper-based) test is no longer offered as of April 11, 2021, but scores from the test will remain valid for two years after the test date.

TOEFL exam pattern

The TOEFL exam consists of four sections: reading, listening, speaking, and writing, and a total score. It is always recommended that candidates practice more and more because the more they practice TOEFL Sample Papers, the better their scores will be. The TOEFL exam pattern is determined by ETS, the body that administers the TOEFL exam. All preparation material is prepared with an emphasis on the TOEFL test pattern. It is one of the important exams to study abroad.

TOEFL results will be announced online six days after the start of the test. The total TOEFL exam score can be found by summing the scores of all four skill areas. Additionally, during TOEFL registration, candidates are given the opportunity to select up to four institutions to which they can send their score reports. Therefore, after the announcement of the TOEFL results, ETS sends official reports directly to the institutions that the student has chosen.

Don’t worry – we’ve got you covered. Here are some of the steps you may follow to score well!

Step 1: Understand the Format and Content of the TOEFL Exam

The first step in preparing for the TOEFL exam is to familiarize yourself with the format and content of the test. To get a better understanding of the test, you can visit the ETS website (the organization that administers the TOEFL exam) and download practice materials and sample questions. You can also find study guides and other resources online that provide an overview of the exam.

Step 2: Set Realistic Goals

Before you start studying, it’s important to set realistic goals for yourself. Consider your current English language skills and your reasons for taking the TOEFL exam. How much time do you have to study? What score do you need to achieve your goals? By setting clear and achievable goals, you’ll be able to focus your efforts and stay motivated throughout the study process.

Step 3: Create a Study Plan

Now that you have a better understanding of the test and your goals, it’s time to create a study plan. Consider your schedule, your learning style, and your strengths and weaknesses. Do you learn better in a structured environment or do you prefer to study on your own? Do you need to spend more time practicing your speaking skills or your reading comprehension? By creating a study plan that works for you, you’ll be more likely to stick with it and make progress.

Step 4: Practice, Practice, Practice

The key to success on the TOEFL exam is practice. The more you practice, the more comfortable you’ll become with the format and content of the test. You can find practice materials and sample questions online, or you can purchase a study guide or review course. You can also practice speaking and writing by interacting with native English speakers or joining an English language conversation group.

Step 5: Take a TOEFL Practice Test

One of the best ways to prepare for the TOEFL exam is to take a practice test. Practice tests are designed to mimic the format and content of the real exam, so you’ll be able to get a sense of what to expect on test day. You can find practice tests online or through a review course.

Step 6: Review and Reflect

After you’ve completed a practice test, it’s important to review and reflect on your performance. Look at your mistakes and try to understand why you made them. Were you tripped up by a particular grammar rule or vocabulary word? Did you have trouble understanding the audio recordings or texts? By identifying your weaknesses, you’ll be able to focus on your studying and improve your score.

Key Stages in the UK Education System

The UK education system has five key stages that refer to the sets of knowledge and skills students are expected to acquire. This gives parents an idea of class work, achievement levels, and how well their child is doing.

Key Stage 1

During Key Stage 1, pupils aged 5 to 7 focus on developing the foundations of English, math, and science, as well as developing classroom and social manners. At the end of Key Stage 1, teachers within the school access the SATs that students take.

Key Stage 2

During Key Stage 2, primary school specialists raise the level of core subjects further and teach students to write reports, short stories, and narratives. Students start learning French in the final year of Key Stage 2. At the end of Key Stage 2, teachers access the SATs that students take.

Key Stage 3

Starting at Key Stage 3, students aged 11 to 13 are taught by specialist teachers in subjects such as English, math, science, French, Danish, history, geography, art, and PE. Special attention is paid to developing greater independence and the ability to think critically.

Key Stage 4

Pupils aged 14 to 16 in Key Stage Four, the final stage of compulsory education, choose ten subjects from a range of topics and study for two years before taking GCSEs or other exams.

Key Stage 5

During Key Stage 5, also known as Sixth Form or College, students take a more intensive curriculum covering specific subjects such as math and physics to gain A-level certificates. Alternatively, they take the International Baccalaureate curriculum (IB), which is recognized as equivalent to A level, or undertake NVQ/BTEC vocational qualifications. The stage lasts two years.

Features of the UK Education System

The education in this institution is more diverse and transcends the borders of the country because it refers to several states and their structure of education. There are several characteristics of British schools or curricula that make them unique and beneficial in many ways.

Learning the future

The world is changing rapidly and we are all striving to ensure that our younger generation is ready to compete in the future. This means that education should teach them to be those who have a more positive outlook on the future.

WANT TO STUDY ABROAD ?? KNOW MORE

Personality development

We are aware that the generation we are dealing with has a particular focus on personal development and professional growth. So, when it comes to education, along with studying and understanding academics, students are also looking for how they can become better people than they were yesterday.

International standard

As already mentioned, this education system covers global standards and has come up with a system that applies to all standards and in most countries. This will allow students to create a more harmonious environment and become more responsible individuals.

Critical thinking skills

Schools that follow the British framework will develop skills among students to enable them to research and investigate any problem they face in their daily lives and even in class. In other words, the best British schools will enrich students with the right number of important skills that will help them later in life.

UK Education System for Indian Students

Excellent, top-notch education, endless reading options, modern academic approaches, educational process opportunities, destiny prospects, hands-on practice, and an all-around exciting study experience in one of the world’s first-class international locations are just a number of reasons why Indian college students should observe UK universities.

Now let’s understand how is UK education system different from the Indian Education system.

UK vs Indian Education System

The difference between the education system in UK and India is as follows:

UK Education System	Indian Education System
UK has an edge over India when it comes to postgraduate and doctoral programs.	Undergraduate courses in India are better for students mainly in terms of cost.
The UK education system allows students to be creative and emphasizes practical learning.	The Indian education system is oriented more toward theory than practice.
Master’s programs in the UK are shortened and can be completed in one year.	Master’s courses in India last 2-3 years.
The UK education system offers opportunities to develop skills. Students receive projects that require intensive research that help in management skills.	The Indian education system mainly focuses on students learning what is important to get good marks in the exam.
The UK education system is advanced in terms of the use of technology. Online enrollment is offered to students and the use of projectors and educational software is quite common in the UK.	In India, on the other hand, there are very few schools with modern equipment, especially in rural areas.

Grading System in the UK

The UK education system follows a unique grading system that varies slightly from country to country. For example, the grading system for England, Wales, and Northern Ireland is identical, while the Scottish grading system is different. The assessment framework contains several elements that highlight your academic strengths, weaknesses, and specific skills, which is beneficial when looking for a job as an employee because employers get a transparent view of your overall performance.

Let’s take a look at the UK grading system using the table we’ve created below.

Grade 	Percentage	Grade Definition 	Honours Degree	Founders Degree
A	70 to 100%	Excellent to outstanding	First	Distinction
B	60 to 69%	Good to very good	Upper second 2:1	Merit
C	50 to 59%	satisfying	Lower second 2:2	Pass 
D	40 to 49%	Sufficient 	Third 3	Pass
E	30 to 39%	Unsatisfactory	Fail	Fail
F	0 to 29%	Unsatisfactory 	Fail	Fail

What are Intakes?

Intake refers to the number of applicants accepted by a company, particularly a college or university, at a given time. Between an applicant’s screening and admission, some intake procedures need several steps, whereas other programs only need applicants to fill out an intake form.

Here is the list of different types of intakes in the United States with their duration.

Spring Intake	Intake for the spring in the USA begins in January and lasts through April or May.

Take admission and start your studies in other US intakes if you must miss one intake owing to unavoidable reasons.

To make it easier for you, we have created a quick guide to everything you need to know about the UK PR process. 

Before moving further let’s first understand what is PR.

What is UK PR?

Permanent residence, short for PR, in the United Kingdom, gives individuals the permission they need to study, work or legally do business in the United Kingdom. In 2019, the UK Home Office established the European Union Settlement Scheme to certify EU (European Union) residents living in the UK before the UK leaves, leaves, or withdraws from the EU (also known as Brexit). Under existing immigration policy, this immigration status can only be granted to those who do not have the right to abode or permanent residence for EEA nationals, that is, those who do not have the right to abode in the UK. However, if a person spends more than two years continuously outside the UK after already having UK permanent resident status, their PR visa is likely to be canceled.

Who can apply for UK PR?

You can apply for permanent residence in the UK after living legally in the country for a certain number of years. You can usually apply for a permit after living in the UK for five years, however, there are other ways to get permanent residence and these depend on the original visa you purchased.

Below is a list showing the length of time you must spend in the UK on different visas to be able to apply for Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR)*:

Illegal stay: 14 years
Tier 1 and Tier 2 work permit: 5 years
Investor, athlete, business owner: 5 years
Origin: 5 years

If your stay in the UK falls into any of the above categories and you have completed the stated period of time, you may be eligible to apply to live in the UK and obtain UK permanent residence.

*ILR: ILR (Indefinite Leave to Remain) is similar to Permanent Residence (PR) in the UK. It gives foreign nationals immigration status to live, study and work in the UK without any time limit.

A letter of recommendation is one of the most crucial pieces of an overseas application. It speaks of character, credibility, work ethic, knowledge, and overall capability. A well-written letter of recommendation can add immense value and weight to an application, and sometimes be the make-or-break deciding factor for admission committees. 

Even though we all understand the importance of an LOR, we may not feel equipped to write one for a student or a colleague. It can also seem like a thankless job, but please know that your effort will make a big difference in someone’s life and future. 

So what really makes for a good letter of recommendation? Let’s try and decode it.

Undergraduate Letter of Recommendation

If you are writing a letter of recommendation for a student applying for an undergraduate degree, you are probably writing as a subject teacher or counselor. You must start keeping these points in mind:

Ask the student to give you a brag sheet or resume – As a teacher or counselor, you cannot be expected to keep track of achievements of each of your students. To write an accurate and custom LOR, you can ask your students to create a brag sheet with a list of all their accomplishments. This will make sure that you don’t miss out on essential information.
Begin with an introduction – The first paragraph should explain who you are, and your relationship to the student. Do mention how long you have known the student, and in what capacity. Whether your relationship is formal or informal, the LOR should reflect that. 
Elucidate student qualities and achievements – You need to talk about your recommended’s academic and personal qualities. Try to support your statements with factual data by including grades, awards, certificates received, etc. Include instances of excellence in sports or extracurricular activities, if any. Stints in Public speaking like MUNs, school captaincy, and other leadership positions should be addressed. Volunteer work, internships, projects, summer schools, and job shadowing experiences should be included too. Remember not to make this part sound like a resume, focus on the story and evidence you can give to support their qualities. 
Include ambitions and personal goals – If the recommended person has a talent or ambition that fuels them, make sure to include it. You can also mention the student’s plans or goals after their education. Any personal motivation, failures, challenges, or unusual family circumstances should be included as well.  All these points depict a deeper insight into how well you know the student, and hence should not be ignored. 
Be true and honest to the student and yourself – Each student you write the recommendation for will be unique, so do not try to write similar and only praiseworthy LORs. Focus on the strength of each student in their LOR and elaborate on that. Do not write a very academically focused letter if the student is not. Focus more on other activities that he/she excels in. Also, tailor your letter according to your subject and include classroom behavior and performance. 
Proofread and check for errors – Read, read and read again! Check for spelling and syntax errors, factual errors, and the general tone of the writing piece, which should come across as positive. Try to keep the opening and closing statements interesting and include anecdotes about the student wherever you can. Proofread and edit as many times as you feel necessary. 

GET COUNSELLING FOR STUDYING ABROAD

Postgraduate Letter of Recommendation

The overall format and purpose of a postgraduate LOR are the same as an undergraduate LOR, especially one that comes from faculty members. However, there are some more things to remember when writing an LOR for a colleague/team member as a manager or recruiter. Let’s take a look at them too. 

Start with your association – The recommended can be your peer or someone who has trained or worked under your guidance. Establish that relationship right away and introduce yourself and your organization. 
Write about specific projects and deliverables – Write about the major projects your colleague has been involved in and the impact they have created because of their involvement. If they have contributed over and above their work role in other areas, mention that as well. Food drives, CSR projects, training activities, and any other role beyond their work’s scope should be written about. 
Focus on transferable skills – Including transferable skills such as Time Management, Critical Thinking, Decision Making, Communication, and more can be a great way to highlight your colleague’s qualities, but make sure to include specific instances to showcase them. Try to avoid using common adjectives like ‘hard-working’, ‘team player, or ‘reliable’ without any real anecdotes.
Personal qualities – Do not hesitate to go beyond professional relationships and talk about unique qualities that you find admirable. It could be their resilience or empathy, their attitude towards life and work, or even their infectious energy. Write first-hand experiences about aspects of their personality and it will add a whole new layer to your letter. 

With these tips, you will find yourself writing a great letter of recommendation in no time. Practice and time make perfect, so don’t be too hard on yourself. Your recommended will be thankful for your effort and for playing such a massive role in their academic and professional life!

The United States and the United Kingdom offer very different experiences for students, ranking among the top three study-abroad destinations for international students.

UK vs US: Education system 

There are two factors that differentiate UK education from the US education system. One is the method of education, and the other is the duration.

Let’s look at both –

Methodology of education

The US education system is known to have a more hands-on, hands-on approach to learning. Students not only learn theory, but they also focus on projects, research, and internships.

On the other hand, the British education system focuses more on theory, delving deeply into certain subjects and not giving students the opportunity to pursue various electives.

Duration of the course

The period of study is one of the main differences for students who want to study in the US or the UK.

While most undergraduate courses in the US last 4 years, in the UK last 3 years.

Similarly, Master’s programs in the US last for 2 years, while in the UK the same program will only last for a year.

This is why most master’s programs in the US require students to complete 12+4 years of study before applying.

Cost of education in the UK & US

Your exact costs for studying and living in the US and UK will depend on a number of factors. For example, which university you choose, the location of the university, and your lifestyle.

Cost of education

Tuition fees for the same course varies from institution to institution.

But to give you a rough idea, here is the average cost of studying in the UK compared to the US.

UK – 10,000 to 26,000 per year
US – $15,000 to $40,000 per year in the UK

Keep in mind that programs like engineering, medicine, and MBA are more expensive than others.

Cost of living in the UK vs USA

Tuition fees aren’t the only expense you need to consider when calculating the cost of studying abroad.

You also need to set aside some money for accommodation, food, transport, Wi-Fi, travel, and more.

On average, the cost of living in the UK vs the US-

UK – 9,600 to 15,600 per year
US – $8,000 to $12,000 per year

Living in the city will, of course, be more expensive. But you can save by choosing cheaper accommodation options.

Note: In the UK the length of training is shorter. This means that your total tuition fees and cost of living in the UK will be less than in the US.

Immigration Policies

The visa processes for the US and the UK are not very different.

However, it is important to note that the US is stricter when it comes to offering entry to international students.

US interview questions, apart from looking at your subject knowledge, also revolve around your future plans. And if there is even a hint that you plan to stay in the US permanently, your application will be rejected.

The UK is easier on foreign applicants. This is why more students are applying for a UK visa, making the competition much tougher.

You may refer to our USA Student Visa & the UK Student Visa procedure posts for more details.

Stay back policy

After graduating from university in the US, you will have 3 months to get a job.

After that, you can stay for 12 months and work in the US. In addition, STEM students get an additional 24 months to live and work in the country.

This is not the case for the UK.

Britain will allow international students to stay and work for 2 years under a new points-based immigration system. This will be true no matter what major you graduate from, what job you take, or your salary!

For reference: What’s STEM, know about STEM courses in the USA from the post!

Job opportunities: UK vs US

The UK is famous for its low cost of living. This means that wages are lower than in the US, but this is not always the case. The UK has a progressive tax system with higher taxes for those who earn a lot and lower taxes for those who earn less. People in the US pay much more income tax on average than people in the UK. Housing in the US is more expensive than in the UK.

Examining salaries, posts, and the like on our website can give you some idea of ​​what you can expect to earn in the UK. There is a non-profit organization in the US that provides details of financial compensation and benefits in most US cities, so check if there is a similar organization in the UK. If you are looking for opportunities, you may want to consider the UK because there are more opportunities.

Admission requirements for MBA in London

University of London MBA eligibility criteria vary by institution. However, a successful application usually meets the following eligibility requirements:

Academic requirement

To be considered for an MBA program in London, a student must have completed 3-4 years of undergraduate studies at an accredited Indian institution. In addition, these universities require applicants to pass a bachelor’s degree with the required honors. The minimum grade required varies by each London university and is between 65% and 70%.

Work experience

Most London universities require applicants to have some professional work experience for an MBA. When evaluating an application, these institutions take into account the candidate’s work experience, which should ideally be 3 to 4 years.

On the other hand, an Executive MBA requires applicants to have 5 to 10 years of work experience. In addition, these universities consider the role, responsibilities, managerial know-how, and skill development of the student.

Additionally, some students choose universities that do not require work experience as a prerequisite. Some of these educational institutions are

Anglia Ruskin University
Coventry University
University of East London
University of West London
West London College

However, these educational institutions may not provide serious employment assistance to students, in which case they return to their home country for employment. In addition, these institutions require students to have a minimum IELTS score of 5.5.

GMAT Score

The Graduate School Admission Test (GMAT) is designed to assess skills for admission to a graduate management program such as an MBA. It assesses some key abilities of the student such as quantitative, analytical, speaking, reading, and writing skills.

Candidates must pass this exam with a certain minimum score. The minimum qualifying overall GMAT score for admission to London universities for an MBA is an average of 600 points.

In addition, some universities accept international students without GMAT scores, such as

Imperial College Business School
London Business School (LBS)

In addition, other requirements for admission to the above universities are:

Bachelor’s degree in any discipline from a recognized university
Minimum work experience of 2-3 years
Recommendation letter
A valid student visa

Knowledge of the English language

MBA programs in London are often difficult in terms of language. Therefore, universities require foreign candidates to have a good command of the English language. Therefore, students entering these institutions must pass the International English Language Testing System (IELTS) assessment.

To be successful at a London university, candidates must meet the minimum IELTS requirements, which are usually between 6.0 and 7.0.

However, not all London MBA universities require students to pass this exam. An IELTS score is not required for an applicant in the following cases:

If English was the main medium of instruction in his/her school
A UK university considers grades X and XII to assess language proficiency
The university conducts its own exam to assess language skills or conversation
The applicant wants to choose a pre-sessional English language course
The university takes into account many other language assessment tests such as TOEFL, Cambridge English Proficiency (CPE), Trinity College London Integrated Skills in English (ISE) or Duolingo English Test.

Tuition fees

For an Indian student, the total cost of studying in London ranges from INR 24 lakh to INR 80 lakh. However, there are many scholarships that you can explore.

It’s true that investing in an MBA at a top business school can seem like a huge expense. But there is no such thing as a generic MBA. You are graduating with a “Harvard MBA” or “London Business School MBA”. That’s why your choice of business school is perhaps the most important career decision you can make.

An 18-month MBA program at London Business School costs almost £50,000 (about US$80,000) in course fees alone, although the school claims the average salary after graduation is almost three times that. A 21-month MBA program from Wharton costs around US$85,000 with an expected average salary of around US$120,000. In both cases, the return on investment (ROI) of an MBA degree is high.

Cost of Living

The cost of your living in London includes the cost of rent, food, entertainment, travel costs, etc. This is the amount of money you will need to survive in London as a student. However, costs vary depending on the lifestyle you choose.

Why study in Switzerland?

The Swiss brand is recognized internationally. Think of Swiss chocolate, cheese, watches, and Swiss Army knives. What is less well known, however, is the prestigious place the Swiss university system holds in the world.

The Swiss higher education system with several top universities offers students the opportunity to further their education and future career! Besides being a promoter of global engagement, Switzerland is also an ideal choice for international students to study abroad.

Want to learn more about what makes Switzerland one of the best places to study abroad? Here are some reasons:

A world-class education system

Switzerland has a renowned education system, so choosing to study abroad in Switzerland just makes sense! This country is known for its high standards and teaching methods based on active learning. It is not only a quality education system but also an affordable one. Tuition fees at many well-known public universities in Switzerland do not exceed 1,000 Swiss francs or 1,100 USD.

Each country accepts several international students. Switzerland too! A significant part of the students in Switzerland are foreigners. The renowned education system, moderate prices, and many scholarship options attract international students to move and study in Switzerland to obtain a degree.

High wages and low unemployment

As one of the countries with the highest standard of living and a stable economy, it makes sense that workers in this country would receive some of the highest wages in Europe. Workers in Switzerland earn an average of 6,502 Swiss francs (US$7,140) per month. Among OECD countries, Switzerland has the second-highest average annual salary at 62,300 Swiss francs (US$68,400).

High quality of life

While Switzerland is one of the most expensive countries to live in, its residents certainly get value for money. In a report by the Social Progress Imperative, Switzerland scored 88.87 out of 100 on three key indicators — basic human needs (health care, housing, and sanitation), the foundations of well-being (education, life expectancy, and access to technology), and opportunity (freedom of choice, tolerance and personal rights).

Swiss multilingualism

Four languages ​​are spoken in Switzerland: German, French, Italian, and Romansh. All of them retain equal status as official languages ​​in the Swiss Confederation. However, the Swiss are not limited to these languages; English is also widely spoken there.

So, even if you don’t speak one of the four official languages, you can still live and communicate with the locals in English — and enjoy the incredible opportunities to learn foreign languages ​​while studying abroad in Switzerland.

For students planning to study abroad, writing an SOP is an important part of the admissions process. Therefore, one should have a clear idea about the use, function, format, and importance of SOP (Statement of Purpose).

A Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a document written by an applicant about himself or herself that is intended to convince the admissions committee to accept that person. As part of the document package, it must meet the standards and meet all the writing requirements. This paperwork requires a clear mind, the ability to analyze, and the talent to tell a short but interesting story about your whole life.

Many students wonder what a statement of purpose is and do not pay enough attention to this document, writing it quickly before the deadline. In tight deadlines, students usually copy from online sources. This causes the test to fail. Someone might write a weak introduction or conclusion, use an informal conversational style or even slang, exceed the word count, use irrelevant information, write an impressive text, and not proofread or edit it. There are so many types of errors that leave no chance of passing the test.

How to properly design this paper and increase the chances of achieving the goal? The work may seem routine, but it is not as unrealistic as it may seem. This post introduces readers to its basic requirements and provides useful practical advice, warnings, and recommendations. Following these guidelines will help you write a brilliant paper and score well on the test.

To make it easier for you, we have created a quick guide to everything you need to know about SOP.   

What is the meaning of SOP? 

The full form of SOP is “Statement of Purpose”. It is an application essay to be written by students who want to enroll in courses at international universities. The main purpose of the SOP is to present yourself, your academic background, career goals, and qualities that make you a worthy candidate for the chosen course. It is important to have a readable objective format.

The admissions committee and supervisors go through the statement of purpose to test your thought process and how well you can express yourself. This allows them to learn more about you through you. It also informs managers about your level of maturity and your plans for the future.

Applicants should highlight their strengths and achievements to impress faculty and committees. This is an important step for admission to foreign universities.

SOP consists of various elements ranging from academic qualifications to personal experience. However, the format of the SOP varies depending on the course, objectives, institution, and country. But the basics remain the same for all. 

What is the purpose of SOP? 

The SOP (Statement of Purpose) is the decision maker for the statement. This helps the admissions committee evaluate your life, your professional goals, beliefs, subject knowledge, and vision. In short, a well-written SOP describes your overall personality to universities. This is an opportunity to explain to the committee your purpose and the reasons why they should choose you over other candidates. A good SOP works well for weak academic profiles where you can compensate by showing your future goals and dreams. A well-written SOP also shows how well you can express yourself using your writing skills.

There are various key points of information that describe how to organize your SOP, from an effective introduction to a great premise and an encouraging conclusion.

Essential steps to writing an SOP

The main guide to an SOP statement is to understand what to include and how to create it. A statement of purpose, like every person, is different in many ways. Needless to say, your experiences and thoughts and ideas, and your dreams will be different and different. However, when it comes to writing them, there are a few rules that everyone should follow. 

We’ll cover them in these 5 essential steps to writing a great SOP.

Step 1: Make a list of your top achievements in school

What you have to provide at the undergraduate level is not three years of work experience or four to five years of study experience. Instead, you have about 12 years of growth. Take a look at the last 12 years; imagine the smallest pleasures and greatest teachers, challenges, and joys of success. Maybe it’s your victory in the state volleyball tournament or your first victory in the intramural debate tournament in fifth grade. Regardless of whether you have 12 years of work experience. So, consider all the situations and if you remember them, there is a good reason to include them in your list.

Step 2: Don’t search for items; instead, think about your lifestyle for that day

Compared to the five fundamentals of SOP writing, this is the only step that is completely invalid. In this case, we recommend that you refrain from any other thought than the story of your life. Basically, it’s a platform where you can discuss all the work you’ve done and how you came to that decision. You are still exploring, deciphering and eager to learn. You have to cover everything, so don’t start looking for leadership patterns or any specifics. You are still capable; be flexible in your SOP and refrain from choosing a specific example.

Step 3: Create your first project

At the UG level, we take this a step further and ask you to start it with writing. This is important even before you start whittling down your lists. We recommend that you start writing your copy as soon as possible before you even have a chance to review what you want to add.

Step 4: Discuss your list and a first draft

Talking to friends, family, and professors on good terms is a great way to start narrowing down your choices. Find out what they think of your writing, what event they prefer to leave you with, and what else you need to discuss. Ask for help to rate and ask for your ideas. Remember that they can look at your achievements from afar and find something more interesting than others.

Step 5: Complete your essay

Now it’s time to finish your essay after discussing the copy and lists. We usually recommend writing a piece. When you’re done, just rewrite your SOP statement. Remember what you want to include in your SOP for the UG course and clearly state your objective. When you’re done, change the paper to remove any grammar or typing problems. Limit the number of times you can rewrite and rewrite your essay. We encourage you to keep reading it until you feel it is the same.

Elements of good SOP format

To begin with, you need to remember a few simple points. Be sure to include these in your SOP review checklist:

The purpose statement follows the paragraph format and follows the general rules associated with essay writing. Although the use of bullets is accepted, they should be avoided and minimized.
Unless otherwise noted, a standard statement of purpose is ideally two pages long, uses a maximum 12-point font, and is double-spaced in regular margins. So, depending on the font type, a standard SOP will be between 800 and 1000 words.
There should be no use of colorful text or images anywhere. The text should be plain black (not even gray).
Ideally, a statement of purpose should consist of 5-7 paragraphs of 150-250 words each.

How to write SOP? 

A simple SOP format helps you gather different pieces of information into a consistent flow. It is divided into different paragraphs for better understanding.

A simple SOP looks like this:

1st paragraph: Introduction

This section is often confused with introducing yourself. However, you only need to submit your chosen academic field. You should state your future expectations for this course. Once you have chosen a course, you should gain some knowledge about that particular field.

In addition, you can discuss your long-term goals, relate your goals to the course of your choice, and describe your understanding of the course. You should also mention your interest in post-graduation work or training opportunities. For example, some candidates prefer to start working after completing the course, while some prefer to pursue higher education and research.

2nd paragraph: Education

You need to provide information about your school or college. If you don’t have work experience, try to highlight published reports or achievements in any project or assignment.

3rd paragraph: Professional Experience

Students interested in studying abroad usually have some work experience. This can be part-time, study projects, internships, freelance or full-time. Share your skills along with your work experience.

4th paragraph: Reasons for pursuing a particular course

State the reasons why you want to pursue a particular course. Mention the course syllabus and explain the skills you want to improve. Explain how it will help you achieve your goals and benefit your plans.

5th paragraph: Career Goals

This is the most important section where you have to explain the profile of the job you will be working on. Don’t mention anything that might make the supervisors feel that you want to study abroad so that you can settle in a foreign country.

Sample SOP

In this section, we have drafted an SOP sample for your better understanding. Have a look: 

I maintained good academic results from high school to college. With 95% in 12th standard, I was one of the few top names in my college. I also received merit-based awards that further encouraged my undergraduate studies.

As a business administration graduate with a specialization in marketing, I have always been inclined to believe that the rapidly globalizing world has created enormous opportunities for small and large businesses to expand and flourish. In the twenty-first century, at the zenith of social media and digital convergence, the new-age marketing arena has always attracted me and fueled my curiosity about how business intelligence and marketing can come together to help every business.

Throughout graduate school, I participated in events and clubs that partnered with local businesses, which helped me learn marketing at an early stage. I sought to strengthen my foundation and gain experience in various areas of the business world. With the development and changes in the business sector, understanding consumer behavior and patterns have become more important to increase production and sales.

I have participated in several contests and hackathons in my state and have won many awards and cash prizes. Along with my team of friends, I have also organized many such competitions in and outside my college.

Working in various creative industries such as business management and marketing has given me a greater understanding of the dynamics of wider societal perspectives. This led me to believe that the business sector is not primarily about finance and marketing, but also about analytical thinking and creativity. Fortunately, ____ University offers a specialized Business Intelligence program that can help me gain knowledge with the perfect combination of business knowledge and required skills.

I am applying to this university because it has a proven track record of producing some of the best business intelligence professionals in the world. Also, your practical teaching methods and updated study modules will give me a new learning experience.

I am deeply interested in sustainable development, green energy, and healthcare technologies. I want to contribute to these areas with my knowledge and skills.

I hope that you will give me the privilege of pursuing a master’s degree at your prestigious university. I look forward to your reply and wish to join this fruitful association.

Thank You

Cost of studying engineering in Germany 

Germany, which has become a popular academic destination for international students, made headlines when it waived tuition fees for bachelor’s and consecutive master’s programs at public universities. However, graduate students must still pay tuition in some cases.

Tuition fees

If you go to a public university in Germany and get a bachelor’s degree in engineering, you don’t have to pay any tuition fees as mentioned earlier. Germany is also unique in that students from outside the EU/EEA pay the same fees as those within the EU. This is in contrast to major study-abroad destinations, be it the UK or France, where fees for non-residents are more than three to five times the local rate. Even in countries like Australia and USA, international students pay much more than local students.

In the case of a master’s degree, you do not have to pay any fees if it is considered “sequential” or, in other words if it follows directly from a corresponding bachelor’s degree obtained at a German university. You will need to pay a small fee per semester for registration, confirmation, and administration, as well as a semester ticket.

Non-consecutive program fees: If your master’s degree is non-consecutive, you may have to shell out more than €10,000 (US$11,450) per semester.

Private University Tuition Fees: Private universities are expected to be more expensive and charge fees even for undergraduate tuition. Jacobs University, for example, charges about €20,000 per year for undergraduate courses, while it is between €10,000 and €20,000 per year for master’s courses. The fees for MSc Data Engineering and MSc Supply Chain Engineering & Management at the university are €20,000 per year.

No fee for postgraduate students at public universities: Postgraduate studies are free at all German public universities – at least for the first six months of the program. However, graduate students are required to make a semester contribution of €150 (US$170) to €€200 (US$230) for administration and similar other costs.

Are you planning to take a Language Proficiency test? But wondering which one is best for you? CELPIP vs IELTS: Want to know which test wins? Which one is the right fit for you? No wonder competitive exams with flying colors are an important part of the application process if you want to go study abroad. Especially those that are needed to prove your knowledge of a certain language spoken in the country where you want to study. CELPIP and IELTS are also mandatory language proficiency exams. 

The similarity between the Canadian English Language Proficiency Index Program (CELIP) and the International English Language Testing System (IELTS) is that both serve as a test to assess one’s English proficiency. In addition, they are necessary exams for immigration and studying abroad. IELTS is an international-level exam, while CELIP is specifically designed for students to move to or study in Canada and obtain citizenship.

Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC) recognizes both CELPIP and IELTS as some forms of English language testing for immigration purposes. When a final score is proposed, it is compared to the Canadian Language Benchmark (CLB). This benchmark sets national language standards for second language recognition. In this post, we will talk about CELPIP vs IELTS in more detail.

IELTS Academic is given when you are gaining admission to Canadian and non-Canadian speaking universities. Similarly, for professional recognition in Canada, you need to pass academic IELTS.
If you are applying for permanent residence in Canada, you must pass the general IELTS test. A General IETLS test is required for Immigration to Australia, New Zealand, and the UK.
The CELPIP General Test also consists of the Canadian Permanent Residency Application. The CELPIP General test score is accepted by several private colleges in Canada.

CELPIP vs IELTS: How each section is different? 

In this section, we will discuss how each section of both tests is different. Come along… 

CELPIP or IELTS speaking 

Before you decide, consider whether you are more comfortable with a computer or the physical presence of an examiner who will conduct your oral test. Some find it easy to present in front of a person, while others are less confident and will be better at talking to a computer.

There are same 8 speaking tasks in CELPIP General and CELPIP LS. You are tagged based on:

Accomplishing the task
Good vocabulary
Content
Ability to listen

IELTS General and IELTS Academic have the same oral test, that is, you have to speak in front of a person. It speaks to three sections including

Introduction
Presentation
Analysis and discussion
IELTS reading vs CELPIP reading

If you are in the habit of reading books online then CELPIP computer-based test can be easy for you.

CELPIP General Reading is a computer-based test. You will read the questions on the computer and answer them on the computer. These questions need to be completed within the given time and these questions are mostly multiple-choice type questions. Here you have to choose the answer that best suits you. You should fully understand the question to get the right answer.

IELTS General and Academic Reading have different reading texts. In this section, you must have the ability to spell and write clearly and understand how each question works.

CELPIP vs IELTS writing 

As for the writing section, it depends on your comfort level. If you find it easier to write on a computer, then CELPIP and IELTS computer-based tests are good for you. However, if you think you are comfortable with a pencil, then the IELTS paper basis is for you. Computer-based CELPIP and IELTS need two essays. In these essays you must:

Complete the essays within the allotted time
Please provide a complete answer.
Use good structure when writing your essay.
Create coherent arguments.
Use grammatically correct sentences.
Use a polite tone and vocabulary.
CELPIP vs IELTS general test – listening 

CELPIP General and CELPIP LS have the same 40 questions as in IELTS. In CELPIP, you don’t see the questions before the recording, so you should have a good memory to remember. You should be able to take notes quickly. Answer the questions within the given time frame.

Both IELTS General and Academic tests also have 40 questions. Here you will see pre-listening questions, which is a positive compared to CELPIP. You should be able to understand the questions quickly as you have to write in a short amount of time while playing the recording. Make sure the test center you choose should provide you with headphones so you can listen carefully. Otherwise, some test centers use one sound source for all test takers.

Now that we know how each section is different in both tests, let’s discuss some more differences of both tests….

Format: IELTS is a paper-based test followed by a personal interview between the candidate and the examiner. CELPIP is a computer-based test. Why does anyone find it difficult? Social anxiety is a real problem; some may find it difficult to take the IELTS test because they have to use their voice to answer the questions they are asked. They will probably find solace in writing the answers.
Accent: Since CELPIP is specifically for Canadian citizenship and the like, it uses Canadian English, which may not be too different from other English dialects, but some words may sound confusing. IELTS recognizes American, British, and Australian English dialects. India uses a British English dialect, so we wouldn’t have any problems with IELTS.
CELPIP Vs IELTS which is easy? 

Candidates often ask themselves: ‘which test is easy – CELPIP or IELTS?’ The truth is that neither test is easy, but there are some points in the tests that outweigh others when compared.

CELPIP is the Canadian English Language Proficiency Index Program and IELTS stands for International English Language Testing System. These tests are designed to assess English proficiency, both tests are used for study, work, and immigration, although the CELPIP has been specifically considered to assess Canadian English. CELPIP is suitable for people who want to obtain Canadian permanent residence or citizenship.

You will find CELPIP easier than IELTS for reading and listening. Similarly, you will know that IELTS is easier than CELPIP. If you are taking an immigration test, you must keep all the points in mind before you take the test. Before the test, think of all the options that you think you can ace in CELPIP or IELTS. Consider your strengths and weaknesses. In which area do you excel and in which area do you need to improve? For example, if you are a great speaker, you should go for the CELPIP test. If you want a computer-based test you have to go for CELPIP.

Detailed section-wise syllabus for each section

The syllabus for the SAT includes the Reading, Writing, and Mathematics section. In this section, we will provide you with a brief introduction to all 3 sections.

SAT Reading Syllabus

The SAT Reading section is part of the Evidence-Based Reading and Writing section of the SAT. It has a total of 5 passages with 10-11 questions each and there will be a total of 52 questions in the section. Each question has four possible answers. The Reading Comprehension section is designed to assess candidates’ ability to understand the meaning of different contexts and associated terms with meaning and to understand written text.

The SAT contains three critical reading sections:

Reading comprehension – 25 min
Sentence completion – 25 minutes
Critical reading of paragraphs – 20 minutes

The five passages of the reading test include one pair of passages to be read together and four separate passages. Each passage is 500-750 words long.

SAT Writing Syllabus

The writing part lasts 35 minutes. It has 44 multiple-choice questions to be answered based on four passages. This section will test the candidate’s ability to analyze the body of the passage and correct errors. This means they must have excellent grammar, spelling, and general sentence construction. They will also need to identify misinterpreted graphic data, back it up with supporting details, and add relevant stuff to sharpen the argument. The passages they will find in this section will be of four types – narrative, argumentative, informative, and explanatory. The four passages are made up of 400-450 words and the difficulty of the passages varies, with some being more challenging, and others straightforward.

The passages are based on a variety of topics such as science, careers, humanities, history, and social studies. The format and purpose of each passage vary and are as follows:

At least one story is present in the Writing section, which means it describes events in a story-like manner. It could describe the sequence of events in a science experiment. This passage is not based on fiction but could be non-fiction about a historical event
Other passages are either informative, explanatory, or argumentative, meaning that the candidate has to persuade or convince the reader of something.

SAT Math Syllabus

This 80-minute section contains 58 questions to assess the candidate’s mathematical reasoning. The score range is between 200 to 800 and has 45 questions in multiple-choice format. The rest consists of 13 grid questions, which they must answer by circling the appropriate numbers after solving the problems. The SAT Math section is further divided into a “no calculator” and a “calculator” segment, where there are 15 multiple choices plus 5 grid entries and 30 multiple choices plus 8 grid entries. They will also have access to the formulas before they start answering this section for reference.

The SAT contains three math sections

Algebra and Functions – 25 minutes
Geometric statistics – 20 min
Probability and data analysis – 20 minutes

How to prepare for sat exam?

Although you can prepare for SAT in many ways, the College Board, the creator of SAT, believes that these are the five best ways:

Apart from the above, you should keep in mind the following tips:

Set target SAT points according to the colleges to which you want to apply. You can check the percentage rate on various websites.
Take a full-length test every 1-2 weeks under a 3-hour barrier. You should also consider practicing the essay (only if required by the University since the Essay is optional) as much as possible. Reading newspapers and paragraphs is a great way to improve your vocabulary.
You will need to spend a lot of time preparing to increase your score, say about 20 hours to improve 50-100 points, 80 hours to improve 200-300 points, and 150+ hours to improve 300- points 500. These hours should be equally covered in a few weeks, depending on the amount of time you have.
Finally, sit and rest for the day before the test. Sure, it is advice that is hard to follow but resists the urge to read more as it will only make you more anxious and insecure.
A final tip: if you have skipped a lot of questions and do not have time to solve them, choose any answers you choose that you believe are correct. The SAT does not have the correct marking for incorrect answers, so the guesswork might seem like a smart option.

Home to some of the finest universities in the world, the USA has always held strong grounds for hosting what is currently the largest population of international students in any country. High standards of quality education and employment opportunities, coupled with a diverse, multicultural environment, contribute to the country’s popularity as a study-overseas destination. This holds true especially for postgraduate studies, given the focus on practical learning and/or extensive research options, and the flexibility that one receives in terms of specializations even within a multidisciplinary learning environment. Some of the key factors that students consider when pursuing a degree in the USA are as follows: 

Academic Excellence: As per the QS World University Rankings 2022, five out of the ten best universities globally are in the United States, which includes Stanford, Harvard, MIT, CalTech, Yale, and Wharton. Similarly, eight universities in the USA have been ranked within the top 10 by Times Higher Education ranking. Naturally, a degree earned from a university in the USA holds a lot of merit across institutions and employers across the globe – given the wide-ranging scope that the American education system brings in terms of specializations, interdisciplinary research, networking opportunities within the campus itself, and faculty often renowned for their scholarly excellence. 
Diversity: A key USP of a degree overseas is the global exposure that students receive. With cultural diversity being a point of emphasis across most campuses in the US – you can expect to be in the company of people from almost every country across the world, regardless of the institution you expect to attend. This opens up a world of possibilities in and of itself as you get to learn about new cultures, languages, and people all while receiving a fitting degree. 
Employability: A degree from an institution in the USA is almost always guaranteed to harness excellent workplace opportunities owing to the merit of the degree. Whether you’re choosing to pursue a niche field like liberal arts, or something more mainstream like engineering or management – a job offer won’t be difficult to obtain with a prestigious degree in hand. That being said, some of the popular offerings in postgraduate programs are concentrated in STEM fields, as this allows for a 24-month post-study work visa extension. The following courses are currently the most popular choices amongst students looking to pursue their Master’s degree in the USA:
Data Sciences and Analytics:
Computer Science: 
Business Administration/Business Management:
Finance:
Technology: 
Key Eligibility Criteria

In order to pursue a postgraduate degree from the USA, applicants must fulfill the minimum eligibility requirement as stated below:

A minimum of 16 years of education (10 + 2 + 4), with at least a 3.0 CGPA on a 4.0 scale. Essentially, students would require a 4-year Bachelor’s degree in a relevant field.  
ELP (English Language Proficiency) test scores: Most universities in the USA require international students to submit proof of English proficiency. The TOEFL and IELTS are two of the most common and widely administered tests for this purpose. 
Standardized test scores: The GRE is often required by master’s programs across universities in the USA, although some programs are now accepting applications with GRE waivers as well. Similarly, the GMAT is administered and utilized for programs such as MBA. 
Statement of Purpose: Your SOP is an essential part of your application as it is a reflection of who you are. A standard SOP contains information about your personal, academic, and professional experiences – and how these align with, and inspire you, to take up the program of your choice. If you are confused about what goes into an SOP – refer to our blog here!
Letter of Recommendation: Most programs require that you submit 2-3 LoRs from your previous professors, mentors, or workplace managers. 
Academic records: While you can use unofficial transcripts during the online application process, you’d be required to submit official ones upon admission. 

Do note that merely fulfilling these prerequisites does not guarantee admission to a university program. A successful admission is contingent on multiple factors, including your standardized test scores, academic records, statement of purpose, etc. For exhaustive guidance, reach out to us!

Is the PTE exam easier than IELTS?

The IELTS exam is much easier than the PTE because of the marking process. Both of these exams are English proficiency scores. Students who are interested in studying abroad must pass both tests. Both tests are equally important, famous, and mandatory.

What is PTE Passing Score?

PTE scores range from 10-90; however, a PTE passing score is missing. Candidates scoring between 65 and 75 is considered a good PTE score for admission to top universities. For other universities, a PTE score between 50-63 is generally accepted.

Is it easy to get 65 PTE?

It is very difficult to score a minimum of 65 in PTE if you don’t have a proper plan and platform to practice. But first, you should set realistic expectations for yourself and for the PTE exam. That’s right! You will be the one expected to get a score of 65+, so make sure you check what level you are currently at.

To make it easier for you, we have created a quick guide to everything you need to know about the CELPIP exam.

What is the CELPIP exam? 

CELPIP full form is the Canadian English Language Proficiency Index Program and is an English language test that allows test takers to demonstrate their ability to speak English. The CELPIP test is designed by Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) for use by individuals applying for Canadian permanent resident status and citizenship.

This test is fully computer-delivered at our partner testing centers, takes approximately 3 hours to complete, and is completed in one sitting. The test is divided into 4 components: listening, reading, writing, and speaking.

Unlike other English proficiency tests, the CELPIP test does not involve a conversation with a person for the speaking component. Instead, you will respond to on-screen prompts for the oral portion of the test.

Since the test is completed on a computer, your results will be delivered within 4-5 days of the test date and your results will be delivered to you online.

It has 2 versions – CELPIP-General and CELPIP-General LS.

CELPIP General Test

The CELPIP Common Test is accepted by IRCC, the Immigration Consultants of Canada Regulatory Council, and the Real Estate Board of British Columbia. In the general CELPIP test, the candidate’s reading, writing, listening, and speaking skills are tested.

CELPIP-Common LS test

The CELPIP-General LS Test analyses the candidate’s functional listening and speaking skills. This LS test is taken by those who need proof of listening and speaking skills in order to obtain Canadian citizenship. The overall CELPIP test takes almost 3 hours to complete and can be completed in one sitting without a separate interview.

FAQs
Is CELPIP easier than IELTS?

They both have the same difficulty level. The CELPIP test has a longer speaking and listening section than the IELTS, so if these are not your strong points, the IELTS exam has a better chance of success. When we compare the difficulty of CELPIP and IELTS, there is no obvious difference between them. Both exams are difficult and require a good level of English and serious preparation.

How CELPIP score is calculated?

Each test taker’s performance, that is, the test taker’s responses to all tasks in the component, is evaluated by multiple raters. Each CELPIP speaking performance is assessed by a minimum of three speaking assessors and each CELPIP written performance is assessed by a minimum of four writing assessors.

How long is CELPIP valid for CIC?

CELPIP results are considered valid by Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) for two years from the date the results are released. If the CELPIP results become invalid, the affected candidate is removed from the pool and will not be eligible for an ITA for permanent residence.

Cost of studying in the UK for Indian students

The tuition fees in the UK vary on the basis of several factors like the type of college, opted course, the location of the college, etc. The average tuition fee for an international student can range between 12,000 to 35,000 British Pounds per year. Apart from the fees, the cost of living in the UK is comparatively expensive and can cost around 12,000 British Pounds per year. This is the most important factor one must consider before finalizing higher education in the UK.

Although the tuition fees in the UK might appear costlier than most of the other study destinations, the shorter duration of courses compensates for it. Most of the undergraduate courses are of three years duration while the masters’ program is of one-year duration.

Most of the universities in the UK have limited on-campus jobs for international students and it is advisable to register for jobs right after enrolling for admission. When it comes to off-campus jobs, it is comparatively difficult to find such jobs in the UK and it is important to consult your international advisor regarding off-campus jobs so that you don’t violate any of the immigration laws.

Accommodation

There are three types of student visas in France:

Visa de court séjour pour etudes (Schengen short-term student visa): This visa allows you to come to France and study for up to three months without the need for a separate residence visa. This is suitable for those enrolled in language courses or short-term programs.

Visa de long séjour etudes (long-term visa): If you want to study for more than six months, you need to apply for this visa. This type of study visa lasts for the entire course of study in France, i.e., three years for a bachelor’s degree, two years for a master’s degree, and four years for a Ph.D. Long-term visas act as residence permits and are called VLT-TS.

To make it easier for you, we have created a quick guide to everything you need to know about the student visa procedure in Italy. 

Types of Italy Student Visas

Italy is part of the union of 24 European countries known as the Schengen group. This group includes 22 European Union (EU) countries such as Germany, France, Spain, etc. Once you get a Schengen visa, you can use it to travel to any of the 24 Schengen countries. Four main types of Schengen visas can allow you to enter Italy. These are: 

Uniform Schengen Visas (USVs)

The requirements for the Italy student visa are different from the Uniform Schengen visa because the latter consists of visas of category A or C. This allows you to stay in any Schengen country for up to 90 days. While category A is also known as an airport transit visa, category C is the visa most tourists apply for when visiting Schengen countries such as Italy. This Category C visa consists of single-entry, double-entry, and multiple-entry subcategories. In addition, multiple entry visas can be valid for 1, 3, or 5 years.

Limited Territorial Validity (LTV) visas

This type of Schengen visa restricts your travel to one or more Schengen countries according to the specifications of the visa guidelines. In most cases, if you apply for an LTV visa for Italy, you will only be allowed to travel within Italy. This means that you will most likely not be able to visit neighboring Schengen countries with this visa. 

National visas

It’s also known as Schengen visa category D, allowing you to both study and work in Italy. It is important to note that these are single-entry visas and you cannot return to your home country between work or study periods. If you want to get a multi-entry national visa, there are some strict criteria that you must meet.

Student Schengen visa

Finally, the Schengen student visa is something you should consider if you plan to live in Italy for higher education. This type of visa is specifically for third-country nationals whose sole purpose of visiting Italy is to complete an educational degree or course. To apply for this visa, you will need to complete an Italy student visa application form, and once approved, it is valid for 3 months. If the duration of your studies is longer, you need to apply for a long-term Schengen student visa.

GET THE COMPLETE GUIDANCE TO STUDY ABROAD

Who needs an Italy student visa?
Almost everyone needs a visa to study in Italy for more than three months.
Only nationals of the following countries are exempt from obtaining an Italian student visa to enter Italy:
European Union Countries
Switzerland
Norway
Liechtenstein
Iceland
However, even for the aforementioned countries, you need to obtain a residence permit for staying in Italy for three months.
If you are a citizen of a Schengen visa-exempt country and the course lasts less than three months, you do not need an Italy student visa. However, if the course lasts more than three months, you must apply for an Italy student visa from your home country.
If you are already in Italy with a Schengen visa, you need to leave the country and apply for a long-term visa in your home country.
Non-EU nationals cannot apply for a residence permit in Italy without a long-term Italian visa.
How to apply for a student visa in Italy? 

To obtain a student visa in Italy, as an Indian citizen you need to follow the following process: 

Step 1

Higher education institutions confirm admission only if you have a student visa. Other types of visas are not accepted. Therefore, before applying to an Italian college or university, visit the Italian embassy or consulate to submit a pre-application. They have the authority to check and let you know whether you meet the visa requirements or not.

A few things that will work in your favor when you apply for an Italy student visa:

You already have a suitable place of residence in Italy.
You have enough funds to support yourself in Italy and cover your tuition and other expenses during this period.
You have already purchased a valid return ticket to return to your country at the end of the study program, or you have enough money to purchase one.
You are entitled to medical care in Italy or already have a health insurance policy.

Step 2

To apply for a visa, you need to go to the nearest Italian consulate with the following documents that you would have received at the Italian institution where you enrolled:

Letter of acceptance
Enrollment letter
Insurance letter and
Course Schedule
Italy Student visas are issued only for the duration of studies.
Step 3

Non-European citizens must apply for a study permit at the local police station (questura) within eight days of arrival in the country. The applicant must apply to the police station at the place of stay with the following documents:

A valid passport with a study visa to Italy
Proof of finances
Documents on health insurance

If the candidate has to move to another city in Italy, even for a temporary stay, he must notify the police station of his change of address within 15 days.

If students travel outside Italy during their studies, they will only be allowed to re-enter if they have a valid residence permit.

Step 4

All international students in Italy coming from non-European countries should be vigilant about the simultaneity of their residence permits and study visas.

At least 30 days or a month before your residence permit expires, you will need to apply to the Questura or police station to renew your permit for the whole year. For this, you must have proof of financial status, a certificate of enrollment issued by an Italian higher education institution, and all other documents related to the issuance of a residence permit.
Study visas and residence permits for international students are renewed only if they pass at least one exam in the first year of the study program and at least two more exams in subsequent years. However, if a student has taken only one exam during the study visa period due to serious reasons such as very poor health, their residence permit can also be extended. However, in no case will residence permits be issued for more than three years after your chosen study program.

Documents required for Italy Student Visa

Applicants will need to bring the following documents with them to the visa center for a study visa in Italy. These include:

Note: A valid passport with at least two blank visa pages and valid for at least three months after the expected end date of your study program.

Cost of student visa for Italy from India

The amount of the fee should be checked directly on the website of the Visa Center, as the exact cost varies due to fluctuations in the currency exchange rate. The price is charged in euros and varies for different types of visas. Fees also vary by visa type. The cost of a Schengen visa for less than 90 days is less than that of Indian students.

The cost of a visa to Italy for an Italian D student visa is €76 (INR 6,800), while the application fee for a C or visa for less than 5 years is €81 (INR 7,000). Italy’s student visa refusal rate was 8.2 percent in 2017, rising to 9.6 percent in 2018 and then again in 2019 to 9.9 percent.

A note from iDreamCareer’s founder & CEO to students & parents

Keshav, an undergraduate student in the US, came back to India dropping his course mid-way. He did not have much knowledge regarding the admission process and believed that the ‘counsellor agent’ to whom he went to take guidance would help him get into the right university with the right course. He was offered this entire guidance free of cost which was the big attraction.

Keshav did not understand nor think twice about how this entire effort of application guidance was offered free of cost and went ahead with the counselling agency. Admissions done and off to pursue his dreams, Keshav left home with high ambitions and hopes. But, his dreams were shattered within the first year and he came back leaving his course midway, realizing that he has been put on a ‘commission model’ by the agent.

Keshav and millions of students in India are being cheated on the purview of free-of-cost study abroad application guidance. While the offer looks promising especially since it’s free of cost, students & parents have no idea that it’s them who pay from their own pockets for the vested interest of the counselling agents. Let us tell you how.

The great commission model of universities and agents

Step 1: When you apply through counselling agents, the counseling agents apply through a portal/platform where your college application number is locked against that agent with the university.

Step 2: Once you receive an admission offer and pay your 1st-year college fees, your seat then becomes eligible as a ‘commission payment’ to your counselling agent.

Step 3: Only post-completion of the 1st semester, does this commission get paid by the university to the counselling agency.

Remember this commission is generally 10-15% of the first-year fees you have paid to the college. It ranges from 1 lakh to 5 lakh depending on the college and course you pay the fees.

So at one end, you get this feeling that you paid nothing during your admission application process to a counsellor but, in reality, if you see as per the above model, it’s your college fees that make up for this agent’s commission & it is generally much more than the study abroad guidance fees you will pay to any genuine and unbiased counsellor in India.

In the commission model apart from losing more money, you end up with other losses as well,  non-financial & Financial:

Being advised and pushed to a limited set of 5-10 colleges where agents get their commission. These colleges may not be the right fit for you.
Being guided to take up courses that are not the right fit and not of your interest to you as agents get more money for filling specific courses which are not popular maybe (as in the case of Keshav). 
Lesser probability of getting university scholarships. As universities pay for the commission for the seat to the agent, the chances and probability of getting a scholarship are much less. Once you apply, your application is tagged as ‘agent referred student’ in the universities admission system and processed through the application number tracking.

Conclusion

With a counseling agency, you may feel good saving some Rs. 1-2 lakh by not paying for your study abroad guidance process, however, you lose much more than you can imagine. Plus the very fact that it’s your entire career at risk! Is that the price you want to pay?

This article has been written with the view of educating students and parents on this commission model especially after seeing so many students’ careers being put at risk by these agents. We hope this article will educate students and parents and help you make a wiser and safer decision.

To make it easier for you, we have created a quick guide to everything you need to know about the student visa procedure in Ireland. 

Types of student visas in Ireland 

There are two types of student visas in Ireland you can apply for:

Type C study visa: if your study program/course will last less than 3 months, i.e., 90 days
Type D study visa: if your study program/course will last more than 3 months.

Therefore, to apply for a student visa in Ireland, the period of study is very important. It should also be noted that to stay longer than 3 months, non-EU/EEA students must also register with the Garda National Immigration Office. This permits you to stay in Ireland beyond the first 90 days. The same information applies when applying for a student visa to Ireland from India.

If you are applying for an Irish D visa, you will need to follow the Irish Student Visa Checklist which we discuss later in this post.

Wondering to study abroad? All excited to fly overseas for your higher education but the questions of how, when, and where are confusing you? Or decided on the college or the destination but are not sure about how to make a uniform decision to improve your chances of acceptance? Looking for an answer on how starting early can improve your top university acceptance rate? Then make this post your first stepping stone to glory.

Students looking to get into a particular college often want to know how they can increase their chances of getting accepted. Will attending summer programs give them a boost? How about connecting with a local alumna? These questions are a lot common, but there’s one we hear far more than any other: Will an early decision increase my chances? Keep reading to learn how applying Early Decision can affect your chances of acceptance. But…

Do you know?

Colleges with high acceptance rates are the colleges that have easy admission requirements. As per US News, the average college acceptance rate is 68% and the universities with a 10% of acceptance rate are the hardest universities to get admission.

For instance, the acceptance rate of Harvard University was 3.43%, which is why it’s a very popular university.

Now before moving further let’s first understand…

What is the acceptance rate?

Simply put, the acceptance rate is the rate at which a given college accepts applicants. This is the percentage of students the college accepts into its new class based on the total number of students who applied. The acceptance rate is calculated by dividing the number of accepted students by the total number of applications.

Two colleges may admit the same number of students but have completely different acceptance rates. Uh, what? Look at it this way: Harvard accepted 2,056 out of 39,506 applications this year. So, 2,056 ÷ 39,506 = 5.2% acceptance. But if another college also accepted 2,056 students, but the number of applications they received was lower, their acceptance rate would be higher.

Do you know?

Timing and application strategy are key in selective admissions, and applying early can improve your chances of receiving an offer letter – but only if students are prepared. That’s why it’s important to keep your grades up throughout high school, take challenging courses each year, and start making a balanced college bucket list as early as possible.

Now that we know what the acceptance rate is, let’s understand the two different types of early application options.

Early action and Early Decision

Early Action (EA) is a type of early admission offered by some institutions for admission to colleges and universities abroad. Unlike the regular admissions process, EA typically requires students to apply by mid-October or early November instead of January 1st. Students will receive notification from the college on admission decisions by early January, not mid-March or May 1 (which is during the regular admission process)

So, it’s similar to many colleges’ Early Decision (ED) programs. Some colleges offer both ED and EA. ED, however, is a mandatory commitment to enroll; that is, if accepted under ED, the applicant must withdraw all other applications and enroll at that institution. Therefore, ED does not allow applicants to apply to more than one ED college at a time.

Early Action, on the other hand, allows candidates to withdraw an offer if accepted and depending on the program, a candidate can apply to one or more EA colleges as well as one ED college. EA can be the best choice for students who know their preference for one particular college because the student will know the outcome of the application earlier and to varying degrees it allows the student to compare aid offers from a different college.

With this the question comes…

How to know that you are ready to apply early?

Applying early is not an easy decision. Seek career guidance first to make sure applying early is the right move for you. Following are the factors you may consider while deciding whether you are ready or not for an early application:

Strong junior year grades
Strong academic transcript
A good SAT or ACT or TOEFL or IELTS score
Letter of recommendation from relevant instructors
Early start of essay writing
A realistic and balanced list of top colleges

GET THE COMPLETE GUIDANCE TO STUDY ABROAD

Does early action increase the chances of admission?

Applying early is also one of the best ways to increase your percentage or demonstrated interest. Since many early decision options are binding, applying early is the most effective way to let the college know that this is your first choice and that you are fully committed to admission. Even if the decision is not binding, you are still showing your commitment by seeking an admissions decision before applying elsewhere.

Applying early may also benefit certain types of applicants, including athletes, students, and some international students. Colleges strive to build well-rounded classes made up of professionals, and there is often only so much room for students within a particular enrollment category. Colleges look to their institutional needs when evaluating applications, and with some colleges filling more than half of their freshman classes with early applicants, there is a chance that an applicant’s particular major will no longer be an institutional need when it comes time for the regular round.

Take this for example. Imagine asking yourself, “Does early action increase Stanford’s chances?”

For the class of 2020, Stanford’s average acceptance rate was just 3.64 percent. This places it among the most competitive schools not only in the United States but in the entire world! Of the 36,251 students who applied, only 1,329 students were ultimately admitted.

However, a very different story unfolds when you look at the acceptance rate of students who applied through early action that same year.

In 2020, 745 students were enrolled out of 7,822 students who applied early. That’s good for an acceptance rate of 9.52 percent! That’s an acceptance rate that’s almost three times higher than the average student!

Hence proved! Early action is better if you believe that you are all set!

As thousands of Indian students studying medicine in China are currently stuck at home for more than two years because of China’s COVID-19 visa ban.

As per the reports of officials, more than 23,000 Indian students are currently enrolled in various universities in China. Considering that the vast majority of them are medical students, India issued this recommendation.

The advisory highlighted research findings, including the difficulties faced by Indian students in China and the stringent norms they face to qualify to practice medicine in India.

According to the guideline, only 6,387 out of 40,417 students who appeared for the Medical Council of India (MCI) Foreign Medical Graduate Examination from 2015 to 2021 passed the exam.

They also included 45 medical colleges mandated by the Chinese government to award medical degrees over 5 years and 1-year internships. Prospective Indian students are advised not to apply to any colleges other than those listed in the recommendation.

Upon completion of the internship, students must pass the Chinese Medical Qualification Examination and obtain a doctor’s qualification certificate to practice in China.

Where to study abroad

Moving to another country or place is a big decision, and it comes with some things to consider, such as cultural differences, food, weather, living costs, and future prospects. It is worth researching well and shortlisting based on the availability of courses and universities.

Which university to choose

A preferred list of institutions should be prepared with a clear study of what to study in that particular university, delving into the available information.

What course to apply

The selection of the course of interest and the availability of the system at that particular university/location should be considered. List all the information and make a preference list based on your interest, availability, and other considerations like affordability, prospects, etc. Some universities or courses require experience from you before applying and this should also be considered before choosing a course.

Passing multiple exams/tests required to apply to study abroad

Prepare for required tests/exams TOEFL/IELTS/PTE, SAT/ACT, etc. To meet the required criteria, you need to pass these exams and score well to be considered a strong potential candidate.

Follow the deadlines strictly and apply as early as possible

How to study master’s in abroad?

Most people would agree that pursuing a master’s abroad is a good idea. But how do you decide which Master’s degree you should apply for? And in what ways you should base your decision? Following are some of the basic criteria you should keep in mind:

How to apply for study abroad scholarship?

Here’s how to apply for scholarships for studying abroad:

Search

The first step to getting a scholarship to study abroad is to look for one! Contact the universities you’re applying to for country-specific scholarships, or see if there are any subject-specific scholarships available straight from the university.

Qualify

Once you’ve identified a scholarship, make sure you’re eligible for it. It is pointless to apply for a scholarship unless you match the criteria, so make sure you verify and double-check these first. Any time spent applying for a scholarship for which you are ineligible is time squandered.

Find out

When you find a scholarship for which you are eligible, it is also essential to begin studying the scholarship and its source. Learn what they are looking for, and work on those requirements in your essays or application before sending it out.

Demonstrate yourself

It is now the time to put pen to paper and fill out the application form. This is when all of your prior research will come into the picture, use it as your checklist and make sure you mark off everything the scholarship provider is looking for, and back it up with proof.

Continue

It is uncertain that you will be awarded the first scholarship you apply for. As a result, applying for more than one at a time is an excellent idea. Don’t pin all of your expectations on the big scholarships, which are quite competitive. It’s also important to keep in mind that there are only a few scholarships that will cover both your tuition and living expenses; as a result, you’re better off applying for a variety of minor scholarships to boost your chances of receiving some financial assistance for your study abroad journey.

To make it easier for you, we have created a quick guide to everything you need to know about Canada student visa procedure.

Why study in Canada?

There are a few significant pointers that Indian students who want to pursue education in Canada need to consider:

Education System and Best Universities

Canada boasts an education system that is known around the globe for its high quality and research orientation that results in great innovations. It is comparatively easier to get admission to a Canadian University than in other major study destinations. The curriculum in most universities is divided into credit hours, and an undergraduate course lasts for three to four years.

As the reigns of the universities lie in the hands of provincial governments, the study pattern and duration might vary from one university to another. Canada has many universities that are counted among the best universities in the world with a total of 26 universities featuring in the QS World University Ranking.

Education and Living Expenses

While the quality of education and standard of living in Canada is on par with all the developed nations, the cost of education and living in Canada is significantly lower than in countries like the USA and UK. The tuition fees and the living cost for an international student in Canada can differ on the basis of several factors like location, institution and the selected program.

Do you know?

According to the statistics given by ‘Universities Canada,’ a collective institution of 97 Canadian Universities, the average tuition fees, and living expenses can range between 15000 Canadian Dollars (7.5 lakh INR) to 30,000 Canadian Dollars (15 lakh INR) annually. This is just an average figure and some professional courses like Medical, Dentistry, and Veterinary Sciences can cost as high as 50,000 Canadian Dollars (25 lakh INR) per year.

Student Visa and Immigration

Any student willing to pursue a course that lasts longer than six years will need a study permit. The student permit has to be applied for from outside Canada, by the visa authority of your native country. The study permit is sanctioned only after you receive a letter of acceptance from a Canadian University. We will discuss it later on!

Earn while you learn

It becomes necessary for many international students to work during their college years to meet their living expenses. Almost all universities in Canada allow students to work a maximum of 20 hours when the term is going on and full-time (40 hours) during vacations. The average pay for international students can be around 7 to 10 Canadian Dollars (370 to 520 INR) per hour. The student who is enrolled in a recognized Canadian University doesn’t require any work permit to work part-time during the term of their graduation.

Nature’s Classroom

Canada offers you a lot to do outside your classroom. The campuses are furnished with advanced technologies and amenities that motivate you to think about extracurriculars. The universities give huge emphasis on sports, performed arts, and social work. However, you can also think outside of your campus boundaries and exploit the benefits of the vast geographical diversity of Canada with huge mountains, lakes, and exotic beaches.

Why study MBA in the USA?

If you are aspiring to walk in the footsteps of these personalities and pursue a study in America, there are 6 things you must know about studying MBA in the USA and about the American education system:

To gain knowledge

The curriculum of the best B-schools will ultimately prepare you to face challenging situations and provide effective solutions for them. There are other ways to get information: you can browse the internet or talk to senior colleagues, but the environment you will get at a B-school will be completely different and will help you advance in your career.

Adding value to your profile

The skills you will acquire in an MBA program can eventually help you land senior management positions. This will eventually give you the opportunity to develop strategies and lead the organization, whereas previously you may have held less important roles in these organizations.

Career Advancement

Earning an MBA degree is synonymous with career advancement. After spending a lot of time on certain types of work responsibilities, people can start to feel somewhat stagnant. The thought of acquiring new skills that can help you get ahead of your peers and promise to advance your career is often a precursor to an MBA.

Self-Development

The entire MBA process will help you realize your true potential. A higher education degree will open up many opportunities for you as this degree is recognized worldwide and in different sectors. The curriculum is designed in such a way that you will come out a completely different person and have a completely different perspective on different things both professionally and personally.

Specialization

MBA programs also provide an opportunity to pursue a specialization in a particular field. Companies today are looking for candidates who are also well-versed in the industry and their business and can handle the nuances of the business well. This will not only improve your employment prospects but also ensure a promising career.

Networking


Getting an MBA from a top B-school will put you in a whole different league. At the Graduate School of Management, you will have the opportunity to meet some of the brightest minds who are going to be the business leaders of tomorrow. This will help broaden your perspective on various important issues.

With many Indians studying abroad, India is the second-largest country in the world in terms of origin for international students. In spite of this, only 0.3 percent of Indian students chose Japan as their study abroad destination, making Japan the 20th most popular country.

In comparison to other South Asian nations and nations where English is an official or semi-official language, this is quite low. It is the case either because people in India may not fully understand the allure of Japan and the advantages of studying there, or because they may have some reservations about the viability of studying there. 

Japanese government started support for international students, to reserve flight tickets outside of the daily immigration limit, students can request the use of this support from their Japanese school.

Study in Japan for Indian students after 12th

After high school, the majority of the population attends college, university, trade school, or other higher education institution. If you know what subject you want to study in Japan, you pretty much know what to do. Some students find it difficult to identify the right school for themselves, these are the few listed schools offering specialized programs.

5 best countries to study in Europe 

Since the European Union’s inception and with the globalization tendency, it has resulted in a major emphasis on higher education taught in a common language-English. 

Germany

Germany is an amazing study abroad location, with world-class education, vibrant metropolitan life set in gorgeous landscapes, and warm culture that welcomes individuals from all over the world. For students who desire to study in Europe, Germany is the most popular choice.

France 

For international students, France is one of the top attractions. The quality of education, relatively inexpensive tuition fees, and lovely French culture & lifestyle are just a few of its primary benefits. In the ranking of the top European countries for international students, France ranked fifth. The country’s education system includes about 3500 higher education institutes including public universities. Even the tuition fees at French public universities are very minimal because the government subsidizes education. 

Netherlands

The Netherlands has the highest no. of English speakers in-country in contrast with the other European nations with over 2,000 university programs taught in English.  There are 55 universities, including state-funded universities and private universities which are further divided into two categories: universities of applied sciences and research universities.

Every year, the Netherlands welcomes a large number of international students, who are trained to become experts in their fields, in order to keep the international talent in the country, the Dutch government is committed to offering post-study work permits to international students which allows them to stay in the country for a year after their graduation.

Italy 

Italy is the ideal blend of breathtaking history, academic heritage, and cutting-edge research and education. Many of Italy’s institutions are now among the best in the world. It is ranked 10th among the top European nations for international students, with popular courses in the arts & design, international history, and architecture. The tuition fee ranges from 850 to 1,000 euros; however, the Italian government also grants regional and national scholarships between 5,000 to 12,000 euros approx. to help students with the cost of their education.

Advocates Rana Sandeep Busa and Dr Neetu Naidu have recently filed a petition (PIL-Public Interest Litigation) in the Supreme Court of India pleading that displaced medical students from Ukraine of Indian origin who have returned form the war-torn country must be allowed into Indian medical colleges.

Upon the evacuation through Operation Ganga, multiple petitions have been filed in high courts and the Supreme Court. These collectively seek the continuation of studies of Indian medical students from Ukraine in domestic colleges.

Ukraine ranks 11th among the top 15 destinations of Indian medical aspirants

***

Currently, 22,500 Indian students have been evacuated from Ukraine by the Government of India along with nationals from 20 other countries.

Attorney General for India KK Venugopal, 21 March 2022

However, opinion is divided over education of Indian students evacuated from Ukraine. Is it necessary? How to help to the undergraduate students who are back to India due to the ongoing battle?

With or Without NEET?

NEET was made mandatory for studying MBBS abroad, since the year 2019. However, as a one-time arrangement due to the pandemic, MBBS without NEET was allowed for countries like:

Russia
Philippines
China
Ukraine
Japan
USA
Nepal
GET THE COMPLETE GUIDANCE TO STUDY ABROAD
Why Doubt the Returnees now?

So, among these students, there are those who are not NEET-qualified. As a result, the quality of candidates remains questionable. Hence, the authorities are torn apart over the concern. Should all these students be allowed into the Indian medical education system or not? Such a move will not be in the interest of the meritorious and top-ranking students already studying in Indian colleges.

The NMC or the National Medical Council of India recognises degrees only from 5 countries. The US, UK, Australia, Canada and New Zealand. Hence, Ukraine-trained doctors are also required to sit for the licensing exam FMGE upon their return to India.

Moreover, the very low median success rate in FMGE among medical students from Ukraine is a concern too. It ranges approximately between 25-30%, the highest coming from Ivano Frankivsk National Medical University (34%).

GET QUALITY INSIGHTS FROM TRAINED COUNSELLORS. CARE TO CHAT?
The Status Quo

The Maharashtra government supports the admission of medical students from Ukraine. It is thinking of online lessons as a supplement to their missed classes covering parts of the course which the students have lost.

Of the 18,000 medical students from Ukraine, around 2000 are from Maharashtra.
Maharashtra further said that those who had taken admission in Ukraine in or after November 2021 may also be allowed to appear for NEET.
Private institutions like MIT Group of Institutions from Maharashtra have come forward in offering seats for Indian medical students from Ukraine

.

Whereas, Punjab had collectively said that medical students from Ukraine should not be admitted in-state colleges. The Punjab State Medical and Dental Teachers Association (PSMDTA) has decided to formally object as well. They had mentioned that such admissions will not be in the interest of meritorious students already studying in government medical colleges in the state.

Karnataka state government had been discussing about reducing fee for medical courses. They had declared that measures will be taken to ensure continuation of the education of the displaced students from Ukraine.

The Ukrainian government has decided there would be a relaxation for students from the third to the fourth year. The mandatory CROC exam has also been postponed to the next academic year. For the sixth year students, degrees would be offered without taking the mandatory CROC-2 examination. India is also in talks with Kazakhstan, Romania, Hungary and Poland regarding absorption of Indian students displaced due to the war. These countries have similar education systems.

The Latest PIL

Busa and Naidu’s recent PIL seeks specific guidelines or directions from the Supreme Court. This is in respect of admission and continuation of medical studies by displaced students from Ukraine who have left their course midway.

It must be noted here that, the National Medical Commission has allowed foreign medical graduates to complete their internship in India due to the on-going war. This caters to the needs of the already trained doctors. NMC's decision only includes those who have completed their course in Ukraine and have returned before their housestaffship could start.

Busa and Naidu’s recent PIL specifically seeks help for attending to those who have come back before graduating. It has requested the government to step in and provide the necessary framework . This will help in the seamless integration of those students who have left their studies midway into the Indian curriculum. They have sought a Medical Subject Equivalency Orientation Program for admitting medical students from Ukraine into the Indian Curriculum.

Their condition is made further worse especially due to no prospects available for them in near future to go back, study and complete their course in Ukraine.

The plea states, these students coming back have a bleak and poor future. So, help must be extended to them and their families.

Final Thoughts

The GoI must step in & suggest regarding the necessary integration of Indian medical students from Ukraine into the country’s medical curriculum followed by domestic colleges. A lot of Indian students studying in Ukraine have been displaced causing huge financial, mental, physical hardships and academic breakdown.

iDreamCareer is attempting, in its own small way, to ease out the challenges faced by parents of Indian students. Our experts are always ready to help young minds like you from 9th class, 10th class, class 11, class 12 with an aim to select your most-suited career choices.

Different Types of visas

But before that what exactly are visas? These are documents issued by the government that grants permission to foreigners who want to visit the country in question. Unlike passports, which serve as proof of your country of origin, visas are markers that indicate the length of time you will be allowed to stay in a foreign country.

Now, different countries have implemented different types of regulations when it comes to their visa process. The following are the types of visas:

Visa-free travel

Visa-free travel is an advantage where you can visit a country without having to obtain a visa. This applies if both countries in question have the same agreement or if the country you are visiting has unilaterally opened its borders to foreign nationals.

Visa on Arrival

Also known as on-arrival visas, these are granted to the visitor at the port of entry. The entire visa process is initiated and completed at the port of state authorities.

E-Visas

E-Visas are essentially official documents issued online by a country’s immigration officer that grant visitors permission to enter. This is an alternative to regular paper visas that are issued by the embassy of the country in question.

Entry Permits

Countries issue entry permits to their visitors instead of visas. These entry permits are documents that allow foreigners to legally enter and stay in the country for a certain period of time.

Visa requirements for Indian citizens in visa-free countries

When applying for a Visa on Arrival (VOA), Indian citizens may need a set of documents. The exact requirements vary from country to country, but usually include some or all of the following:

Hotel booking or other proof of accommodation, such as an invitation letter.
Passport-size picture.
Proof of booked return flight tickets.
Proof of sufficient funds, such as bank statements.
Valid passport.
Valid travel health insurance.

After the lifting of several COVID-related restrictions between countries for international travel, the Indian passport has regained its strength. Out of 199 passports, the Indian passport was ranked 87th, according to the recently released global passport ranking table.

The Henley Passport Index speaks to the strength of foreign relations between countries. Henley Passport Index publishes data based on these relationships. Depending on the ease of access the country offers, the higher the ranking. This data is compiled for this index obtained from the International Air Transport Association (IATA).

List of countries offering e-Visa

Many countries have implemented e-visa or e-visa services to facilitate tourism in their country. More and more countries are making their visa regulations flexible to encourage domestic tourism, and one of the first steps to achieve this goal is e-visa.

The electronic visa has greatly simplified visa processing for foreign ministries around the world. Governments have come to realize that staffing embassies around the world to process visa applications from tourists is a waste of time, property, and human resources. Plus, it costs them tourist dollars.

The process begins by selecting the desired country to travel to, filling in the visa form with the required personal and travel details, uploading a photograph and scanned supporting documents, and paying for the visa. Applying for an eVisa is generally a simple 3-step process that can be completed in just ten minutes if you have the required documents ready.

However, not all countries currently offer the e-Visa service. Following is the list of countries providing e-visa services with details of eligibility, visa type, fee, duration, payment method, etc.

Kharkiv and Kyiv, where most of Indian students in Ukraine are concentrated, are the 2 largest cities in the country with a joint population of ~ 5 million people. These 2 are among those areas experiencing maximum aggression, shelling and missile strikes from Russian troops in freezing temperatures.

The Situation Now

According to the Global Competitiveness Report by the World Economic Forum, Ukraine ranks 13th in higher professional education.

In 2020, 24% of Ukraine’s overseas students were from India. Although repatriation efforts are on, there are thousands still stuck in bunkers unidentified.

Ukrainian forces have so far managed to hold back the Russian advances and remain in control of Kharkiv and Kyiv, where most of Indian students in Ukraine are concentrated.

All Ukrainian men aged 18-60 are now conscripted to the army. Their women are all armed and equipped, making petrol bombs. The president has urged civilians to join in, as no military aid is reaching them from the world. No civilians can actually leave the country now. Foreign citizens are being repatriated somehow through Romania and elsewhere.

All government websites and Web-based frameworks are currently jammed because of Russia’s cyber-attack. There’s no way of verifying any data now.

Our Prime Minister Modi has also urged students to aim at studying medicine in national universities instead of abroad. He mentioned that most Indian students go to smaller countries to study, especially medicine. Ukraine similarly has a high migration rate.

The four countries viz, Slovakia, Romania, Poland and Hungary share Ukraine’s western border, while Russian army are advancing from the eastern borders. Along with them, the Indian embassy in Georgia is also participating in evacuation efforts.

The MEA teams from Indian Embassies in these countries have reached their respective borders with Ukraine.

PLANNING TO STUDY ABROAD?
How many Indian students and emigrants from each state?

Ukrainian airspace is closed for civilian aircrafts now, which is why, the evacuation flights are being operated out of Bucharest, Romania. The Ukrainian government has also ceased to operate special flights for foreign nationals.

Air India is currently operating 2 flights to and from Bucharest. Our Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla has informed that around 4,000 out of 18,000 Indian nationals stuck in Ukraine have returned.

Chief ministers from various states are repeatedly asking the central authorities (S Jaishankar at the helm) for expedited repatriation efforts and to supplement their action with arrangements for food and other necessities for the students.

The endless wait for our Indian students in Ukraine who are heading back here
Evacuation & Repatriation Facts of PM’s ‘Operation Ganga’

The first Indian flight from Romania carrying 219 Indian students reached Mumbai on Saturday evening. The second evacuation flight from Bucharest (Romania) had landed in Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International Airport at around 2.55am on Sunday, February 27, 2022 with 249 Indian students in Ukraine. The third and fourth flights have already landed the same day.

All transportation costs for repatriated Indian nationals being evacuated from Ukraine will be borne by the government.
Colleges in Ukraine are helping foreign students to get across the Ukrainian border and await their turn to enter Romania or Poland. Georgian ministries are also offering help during repatriation.
Indian embassies in Romania, Poland and Georgia are working hand in hand to make Operation Ganga a success.
Besides, several MEA officials in Hungary and Slovakia are also offering help to students arriving there through land borders.

.

Moreover, special flights of the Ukraine International Airlines (UIA) have also been carrying Indian nationals back here.

Another group of medical students had independently reached Delhi airport, taking Turkish Airlines from Kyiv to Istanbul and then to Qatar, and then from there to Delhi via Qatar Airways.

“We were around 250 students waiting to reach Romania, but now there is chaos at the Ukrainian border and thousands of students have gathered with an aim to return to India. I haven’t slept for 4 days and yet, I’m worried because my friends are still stuck there. I have been receiving calls from their parents and all this is making me anxious.”

Aarushi Mamgain, a third year MBBS student, a Dehradun resident
Hard-etched memories

Mamgain was among the second batch to be evacuated by Indian authorities and has safely landed. Some colleges and associated hostels have only started operating fully in the past week after COVID rules were lifted. Some students have just travelled to Ukraine as their classes have resumed and are finding it difficult to come back now.

On the other hand, some students are making independent efforts to fly out of the country. Earlier a flight ticket was sold for Rs 25,000 and is now available for Rs 75,000.

Monika, a resident of Chhattisgarh and a 5th year MBBS student, took a flight from Kyiv to Doha and then returned to Delhi. Since air tickets were quite expensive, she came to India taking other flights.

Students are made to wait at the Ukrainian border for hours. Some students had to walk at least 15 kms crossing the Ukraine border to Poland for boarding flights.

Most of them are made to wait at petrol pumps and then board a bus that drops them at Bucharest airport. It is a 7-hour journey, but the government is helping them with assistance and food wherever possible.

Why Indian students go to Ukraine for MBBS?

Eastern Europe is very popular among medical aspirants form India. Affordability makes Ukraine a top choice for medical students.

Hundreds of students every year choose medicine courses in Ukraine, China, Philippines and Russia as the universities there are cheaper than medical colleges in India.

Getting an entry into Ukranian colleges is a lot easier because of less competition.
The average fee to study medicine in a government college in India is ₹2 lakh but not many get admission. Private colleges, in India, charge anywhere between ₹10-15 lakh per year, which means at least ₹50 lakh towards fees for a four-and-a-half year course.
In Ukraine’s private medical colleges the average fees lowers to approximately ₹3-5 lakh per year, which is significantly lower.
There is no entrance exam before admission and the medium of instruction in medical colleges is English
A Ukrainian medical degree is recognised world-over, including in India.
The number of medical specialties offered by medical colleges in Ukraine are also vast.
Ukraine ranks 4th in Europe for having the largest number of UG and PG specialisations in medicine.

.

Foreign-trained students from Ukraine must clear the Foreign Medical Graduates Examination (FMGE) exam upon their return to India.

The National Medical Council of India recognises degrees only from 5 countries — US, UK, Australia, Canada and New Zealand.

Doctors having graduated from any other country, besides above 5, need to clear FMGE.

Medical colleges in Canada are altogether 17 in number. All these schools grant the MD, or Doctor of Medicine, degree over the course of a 3- or 4-year focal curriculum (excluding variable months of preparatory modules), with MCAT score being a mandatory selection criterion for most.

Previously, the Medical Council of India (MCI), had endorsed and approved certain foreign institutions that MBBS aspirants can go to. However, the MCI has been replaced by the National Medical Commission now.

The NMC does not endorse any list of Foreign Medical Institutions/ Universities for MBBS anymore.

FMGE Examination

After coming back to India as a foreign-trained medical graduate, you will have to clear Medical Council of India (MCI) Exam which is also known as “Foreign Medical Graduates Examination (FMGE)”. FMGE is a licensure examination for those Indian students who have pursued MBBS from abroad. FMGE is conducted twice a year and you will require 50% to pass.

MCI or FMGE Examination is compulsory till now and is conducted by the National Board of Examination (NBE) in India. Foreign medical graduates are required to write the FMGE to become eligible to practice here.

The success rate of FMGE is extremely low and competition is very steep. Here we have mentioned some of the popular pathways to study as well as practice medicine in select countries. However, you can always come back to practice in India after being trained as a medic abroad but FMGE is a mandate before you start practicing here.

MCAT or No MCAT?

“Without MCAT” should not be a choice for you as international students are mostly judged through MCAT scores in Canada with the exception of 5 colleges.

Out of these 5 exceptions, 3 schools are either only francophone (French speaking) or bilingual. Other than these few, all medical colleges in Canada require or recommend MCAT.

These 5 exceptions are:
The University of Ottawa
Montréal Université
Laval Université
Sherbrooke Université
Northern Ontario School of Medicine
2 further exceptions:
McGill University
Acceptance rate for McGill is highly inflated because McGill loves accepting international students!
MCAT is optional here only if you’ve obtained a basis-of-admission (pre-med) degree from a Canadian university
McMaster University
Selection committee uses only 4th section of the MCAT exam for admission
However, all applicants are required to write MCAT prior to the application deadline

Air Bubble Agreement: Definitions

“Transport Bubbles” or “Air Travel Arrangements” are temporary arrangements between two countries aimed at restarting commercial passenger services when regular international flights are suspended as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. They are reciprocal in nature, meaning airlines from both countries enjoy similar benefits.

Ministry of Civil Aviation, India
‘Travel Bubble’ or Air Bubble Agreements – National agreements that enable international air travel between 2 (or more) countries based on a mutually agreed set of public health mitigation measures.
Public health mitigation measures – Testing, self-isolation, quarantine, insurance, medical certificate, contact tracing or health declarations required of passengers as a result of the pandemic.
Country COVID Transmission Level – The status of a country in terms of the risk of an incoming or outbound passenger & additional infections.

.

What does this mean for Indian students?

This is excellent news for students aiming to study abroad in the upcoming 2022 intakes.

All these countries have their borders open to eligible visa holders, including international students and skilled migrants. These air bubble agreements have lifted the spirits of the bridging visa holders and Indian students who want to study abroad in the upcoming seasons.

Many are planning to travel from India to their colleges abroad to complete their ongoing courses. Recent agreements (like with Australia) have relieved those who suffered huge costs due to suspension of flights as per previous notifications. The students looking for admission in the upcoming intakes of universities abroad can start working on their applications and Visas.

Types of Air Bubble Agreement

3 main types of travel bubbles can be envisaged:

The Basic Travel Bubble (BTB) with the standard set of public health risk mitigation measures;
The Limited Travel Bubble (LTB) with an additional requirement for a test within 24-48 hours of departure;
The Extended Travel Bubble (ETB) with a requirement for a test within 24-48 hours of departure and a second test within 24-48 hours of arrival

[Source: Restarting International Aviation through ‘Travel Bubbles’ (IATA)]

WANT TO STUDY ABROAD?
Multilateral Air Bubble Agreement

Although the default model for travel bubbles is bilateral, countries are always encouraged to consider forming multilateral bubbles. These tie together more than 2 countries.

For example, existing multi-national institutions (e.g. EU, ASEAN) can provide the forum and facilitate discussions on the formation of such multilateral bubbles. Also, bilateral bubbles can be merged or expanded to multi-lateral travel bubbles.

Air Bubble Reviews

All Air Bubble agreements are subjected to periodic review and adjustments for catering to changes in pandemic situation, health environments, testing methods, or any other factors that can impact traveling passengers and/or origin-destination countries. You must keep a check on and be wary of changing legalities at all times.

About Testing Before & After

A test prior to departure could reduce the risk by up to 90%.

A second test after arrival for the highest risk markets could reduce risk by as much as 99% enabling air travel to resume between the vast majority of countries without a quarantine requirement.

It should be a PCR test (preferably saliva-based), where testing is required, carried out in the 24-48 hours immediately prior to or subsequent to travel. Therefore, not done at the airport at either times.

Data transmission relating to the sharing of results with the country of arrival must be between passengers and governments.

GET THE COMPLETE GUIDANCE TO STUDY ABROAD
Travel Bubbles, Risks and Benefits

Let’s talk about certain essential elements of air bubble agreements.

One of the benefits:

The measures applied in a given bubble can be customized as and when required so as to effectively match the requirements of origin and destination countries. In order to make this possible, an appropriate risk assessment framework is always constructed. Keep a check on the Bureau of Immigration portal page shared in the last section for latest changes to respective air bubble agreements.

Risks:

While risk measurement is not accurately possible under any circumstances, the following aspects are definitely taken into account:

Current infection rates, relative to population size
Trend in infection rates (decreasing, stable, increasing) compared to a previous time period
Effectiveness of overall public health response to the pandemic in each country.

.

Final words

Traveling abroad during this time? It is recommended to wait if possible. Else, do keep up with the recent updates regarding travel bubbles and airlines/ carriers that are operating during these times.

Although all governments are making immense effort to provide a pre-COVID experience to passengers, it is ultimately up to them whether they want to cooperate to make these agreements successful.

If you are still not sure about studying abroad or are looking for overseas education consultants, iDreamCareer can help. With the help of our Career Counselling and Guidance Services and educational counsellors, we try to help puzzled minds from 9th class, 10th class, class 11, class 12 with an aim to select suitable career choices.

To make it easier for you, we have created a quick guide to everything you need to know about the CPA course.

What is CPA Course?

The CPA credential is the only licensing qualification in accounting & auditing in the US and is accepted globally. CPAs are in demand and needed everywhere – at public accounting firms (including Big 4) and at every company whether big or small (including MNCs).

There are 55 jurisdictions (50 states & 5 U.S. territories) with independent Boards of Accountancy. You must pass all four sections of the CPA Exam within 18 months. It is a computer-based test. You cannot take it on paper.

It’s Indian counterpart

The Indian CA qualification isn’t recognized in the USA. Although there is CPA and chartered accountant reciprocity between the US and some countries, no agreements currently exist between the US and India.

Therefore, an Indian CA wishing to work as a professional certified public accountant in the US must apply for the CPA course too.

What is CPA Course? – This is the only accepted US qualification for practising as a professional certified public accountant.

CPA Course Details

CPA is a qualification accepted in the US whereas, India only has a handful of companies working under US accounting standards, hence prospects here in our country are at best moderately bleak with a CPA qualification.

The median salary for a CPA in the U.S. is $60,000+ and in India, approximately, Rs 8–10 lakh a year and the median salary for a CA in India is. 6.5 to 7.8 lakh a year.

*Figures are approximate & indicative only. Please use discretion.

If you plan to only work in the United States, you will only need the CPA without the CA. If you plan to only work for non-US companies in India or other companies that are not traded on US markets, you may only need the Indian CA.

You can read more about the basic medical training requirements that your qualification must meet if you do not have a UK or equivalent European qualification.

Qualifications that meet these criteria are considered acceptable for taking the PLAB test or applying for registration with us. This does not mean that such a qualification will always be acceptable, as the criteria may change. The criteria applicable at the time of passing the PLAB or applying for registration with us apply.

World Directory of Medical Schools

Your qualification must be awarded by an institution listed in the World Directory of Medical Schools.

If a qualification is not listed in the catalogue, we may still accept it if the reason it is not listed is:

the qualifying country is not recognized by the UN, or
the institution that awarded the qualification no longer exists or no longer provides medical education and we are confident that the qualification is valid.

In each of these circumstances, the qualification must meet all other criteria for the foreign qualification to be acceptable.

Where appropriate, the institution listed in the directory must have sufficient contact information (address or email address, fax or telephone number) to enable the qualifications issued by it to be verified.

Clinical rotations

As part of your basic medical qualification, you must complete a clinical rotation (clinical placement) that has given you relevant clinical experience. This means clinical rotations:

had to be of acceptable duration
exposure to medicine and surgery is included
were supervised or approved by the institution you attended
is part of your overall training program.
If you studied at more than one institution

If you studied at more than one institution and the research contributed to your underlying medical qualification, we need to be sure that:

the institution is part of a recognized twinning program or a recognized campus of another institution, or
it was not possible to get a qualification in one institution for valid reasons.

Course credits that contributed to your qualification must not include credits transferred from another institution where you failed.

European medical qualification

If you have a medical qualification awarded in the EEA or Switzerland, it can be classified as a corresponding European qualification, unless it has been designated by the General Council.

Note: The GMC may from time-to-time issue notifications to change the PLAB eligibility criteria.

PLAB Exam Syllabus

What after PLAB exam?

Now the question comes what to do after PLAB exam? or How to join as a Doctor in UK? Here is the answer- In the UK there is a complex system of different doctors depending on their experience, competence, and knowledge. Let’s put it plainly.

Let’s say you have completed primary medicine (MBBS in India) with four and a half years of courses and one year of compulsory internship (this may vary from country to country).
But in the UK, this MBBS or primary medicine degree is obtained immediately after 4-6 years of study.
They will intern as Foundation Doctors for two years (FY1 and FY2). During this period, they will rotate between the departments of general surgery, general medicine, obstetrics and gynecology, paediatrics, geriatrics, emergency medicine, and psychiatry.
After passing the PLAB exam, when you enter the UK, you will be at the same level as the FY2 Foundation Doctors. 

After PLAB, there will be several options for further action. And they are: 

Starting FY1 without training is NOT recommended (because you are doing the same thing again and wasting your time)
Starting with a non-training level of FY 2 is highly recommended
It is recommended to start training at the CT1 / ST1 level
You will complete 2 to 3 years of basic or specialized training depending on your major (Completion of CT 1,2,3 or ST 1,2,3)
At this level you will need to pass the MRCP/MRCS exams
Then there will be specialty training from ST 3+ to ST9
You will now be recognized as a general practitioner or consultant

FAQs
What is PLAB exam?

The PLAB test is a competitive skills-based examination that ensures that doctors educated outside the United Kingdom have the necessary knowledge and ability to practice medicine in the United Kingdom.

Is the PLAB exam difficult?

Many people find it difficult to answer all 180 questions in the 3-hour time limit. Leaving questions unanswered means automatic failure. Although you can take the exam four times, it is best to pass it on the first try. This can save time and money.

How to apply for the PLAB exam?

You must apply online through the General Medical Council (GMC) website. To find out how to do this, visit the GMC Registration and Licensing page.

How to register for PLAB 1 exam?

To register for the PLAB 1 exam, you need to set up a GMC online account and provide the following details – primary medical qualification, valid passport, postal address, and email address.

How long is PLAB 1 & PLAB 2 exam?

PLAB 1 – This exam is conducted in MCQ format consisting of 180 questions to be solved in 3 hours. PLAB 2 – This part includes an Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) consisting of 18 clinical stations. Each station is 18 minutes long with 2 minutes of reading time.

How difficult is the PLAB exam?

The PLAB test assesses you against the level of knowledge and skills expected of doctors starting their second year of Foundation training in the UK. To get a deeper understanding of the level of difficulty, you can explore the Foundation Program syllabus here. In 2020, only 69% of candidates passed PLAB 1. Therefore, it is vital that when you answer the questions, you read them fully and take note of the explanations.

Which is better – USMLE or PLAB?

USMLE is the licensing test for America and PLAB is for the UK. USMLE has basically 3 stages and PLAB is 2 stages. After completing or passing one of the tests, you will receive an MD degree, which is equivalent to our MBBS degree. A student’s choice for USMLE or PLAB depends on several factors, which include the choice of residence, financial situation, relatives living in the US or UK, the culture and environment of the country to which they can easily adapt, and several other factors.

We know that scholarships to study abroad are always a popular topic, which is why we’ve put together a guide to help you on your scholarship search.

Many students wish to study overseas, and that desire is not inexpensive. For many international students a scholarship is the only means to pursue it.

But even if you have applied for scholarship, it’s not necessary you will get one. There are many scholarship applications that end up getting rejected.

There are few common mistakes students make while applying for scholarships. They may appear to be common sense – but avoid them if you want your application to be successful!

Conclusions
Start your scholarship hunt

Here are few steps for you to start your scholarship hunt:

Search

The first step to get a scholarship to study abroad is to look for one! Contact the universities you’re applying to for country-specific scholarships, or see if there are any subject-specific scholarships available straight from the university..

Qualify

Once you’ve identified a scholarship, make sure you’re eligible for it. It is pointless to apply for a scholarship unless you match the criteria, so make sure you verify and double-check these first. Any time spent applying for a scholarship for which you are ineligible is time squandered.

Find out

When you find a scholarship for which you are eligible, it is also essential to begin studying the scholarship and its source. Learn what they are looking for, work on those requirements in your essays or application before sending it out.

Demonstrate yourself

It is now the time to put pen to paper and fill out the application form. This is when all of your prior research will come into picture, use it as your checklist and make sure you mark off everything the scholarship provider is looking for, and back it up with proof.

Continue

It is uncertain that you will be awarded the first scholarship you apply for. As a result, applying for more than one at a time is an excellent idea. Don’t pin all of your expectations on the big scholarships, which are quite competitive. It’s also important to keep in mind that there are only a few scholarships that will cover both your tuition and living expenses; as a result, you’re better off applying for a variety of minor scholarships to boost your chances of receiving some financial assistance for your study abroad journey.

Why study MBBS abroad?

For many, it is a dream, but few come true!

Medicine is one of the most sought-after professions in India. This is a profession that many parents or any other person would like to pursue as a career.

Currently, MBBS in India has 70,978 seats in 529 colleges. Of these, 269 are government colleges offering 35,688 seats, while the remaining 260 colleges are private colleges offering 35,290 seats.

The medical education system in India has been one of the major concerns of the people of India for many years. There are only a few government medical seats in India. Few students manage to pass the entrance test as it is one of the most difficult entrance exams at the national medical level. Others who can’t pass the tests are looking for other options. The increasing demand for medical education in India and a smaller number of seats in government medical colleges leads to another option where students have to seek admission to private institutions. However, most students cannot afford the tuition fees in India as the donations in private universities are very high.

Another reason why some Indian private medical institutions have failed to achieve a high standard of medical education is the lack of qualified doctors on staff. Lack of modern infrastructure in institutes, as well as fewer research institutions. It is an integral part of medical education. The lack of this infrastructure affects the learning process of students. To keep pace with the medical education system in India, new diseases require new treatments and modern technologies.

Scholarship for Indian students to study MBBS abroad

Medical scholarships provide incentives not only to students who want to pursue MBBS but also to those who want to pursue nursing, dentistry, pharmacy, and other allied subjects. It’s common knowledge that paying for medical school is expensive, which is why scholarships for medical students are so important. Some colleges, foundations, business organizations, and governments have various types of scholarships for MBBS students to make medical education affordable.

Following is the list of scholarships for MBBS students to study abroad:

Name of Scholarship	Amount
Algoma University Chancellor’s Award	$ 5,000 per year
Beijing Government MBBS Scholarship	20,000 RMB
Global Study Awards	10,000 Pounds to two students
JGCS Scholarship	¥ 300,000 a year
NCI Master’s Edge Scholarship	50% of the tuition fee
Novus Biologicals Scholarship 	USD 1,500 every semester to one student.
TUS Limerick Merit-based Academic Scholarship UG	EURO 3,000 for one time only.
Vice Chancellor’s International MBBS Scholarship, Sydney University	$5,000 for one semester $10,000 for one semester $20,000 for one semester $40,000 for the entire year payable in 2 installments for each semester

Best countries to study MBBS abroad

Colleges in India

In India, there is a dichotomy between an MBA and a PGDM (Post Graduate Diploma in Management). There are currently no colleges in India offering online full-time degree courses in Management which is equivalent to a full-time on-campus program.

Further, AICTE has a standing directive that states that an institution cannot run both PGDM and MBA courses in the same institution. They are permitted to run all courses as either MBA or PGDM.

We have a few noted establishments in India offering PGDM classes and PGDBA (Post Graduate Diploma in Business Administration) in the online mode. We also have PGCM courses (Post Graduate Certificate in Management) which are offered by select colleges in India, through both classrooms as well as online modes.

Online PGCM programs range typically from 12 to 15 months. You are required to complete the program in a minimum time, which is subject to extension, usually till a minimum of 3 years.

List of 20 Colleges in India: For PGDM, PGCM, and PGDBA Courses

While MBA colleges need an affiliation to a university, PGDM/ PGDBA/ PGCM courses (online or offline) need no such affiliations but AICTE/ UGC-DEB approval and/or NBA (National Board of Accreditation) accreditation to run their courses. However, a 2-year PGDM qualification is considered equivalent to an MBA.

The popular specializations offered for online PGCM/ PGDM/ PGDBA courses in India typically are Finance, Marketing, Operations, Human Resources, and Business Analytics.

The following are among noted institutions in India conducting AICTE/ UGC-DEB (Distance Education Board) approved online PGDM/ PGDBA/ PGCM classes (open & distance flexible learning modes).

Few colleges, like ICFAI, also provide online (distance flexible learning) ‘Sectoral MBA’ programs of 2-year duration focused in specific industrial sectors like Hospital Administration, Pharma Management, Telecom Management, Power, Energy, Transportation &Logistics, Aviation, Oil & Gas, Infrastructure, Banking & Insurance, Retail Management, and International Business.

Why They Are The Future?

In 2019, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign announced the closure of its full-time and part-time MBA courses. This was sole because it intends to focus on the expansion of its courses.

The popularity of online-format MBAs has grown massively in recent years. According to Graduate Management Admission Council (GMAC-the body that conducts the GMAT exam), the majority of MBA courses in 2016 reported an increase (to 57%)in applications from just 50% in 2015.

The courses are also available in all price points and lots of different formats.

If you’re hoping to get your MBA while working full-time, running your own small business, or even doing both, you may have a feeling that accommodating your classes in your busy schedule is going to be a tall task. Flexible study options like these online courses are becoming increasingly available and popular.

Because of the absence of any physical travel, you choose from a much broader range of schools when it comes to where you’d like to get your MBA. Some of the best colleges in the world offer these degrees.

Additionally, there are many cheaper options than the traditional MBA. Owing to the fact that the cost of running an online course is relatively low compared to teaching students on-campus, most institutions can afford to drive their tuition prices down to around one-third less.

The credibility of the online degree is certainly better than what it used to be. With the rise of online MBAs, the stigma attached to online degrees has long faded. Online delivery models have become far more trustworthy.

Recruiters today can recognize the amount of self-motivation, self-control, and commitment that online students put in to achieve their goals.

You will have exactly the same well-known and well-respected qualifications with an online course that you would expect with an on-campus qualification. Moreover, you can enjoy a far lower price tag and much more flexibility around learning.

How to choose an Online MBA program

Answer these 4 questions to make an informed choice

Look at the following questions. If you are confused as to which course to choose and have listed hundreds of college options, your answers to these questions can greatly help you to shortlist your options.

By understanding the parameters of various courses, defining your personal & career goals, and thoughtfully answering the following questions, you can build a target list of the best online MBA programs that are most suited to you.

Question 1
Do you want a degree focused on general management or one specializing in an industry or function?

If you want to change direction to or advance your current career in entering a specific industry, consider a model focused on your desired field.

Alternatively, if you’re looking at general management MBA education, you’ll gain an overview of business, like basic disciplines such as accounting, marketing, strategy, finance, economics, etc.

Basic disciplines like accounting, marketing, strategy, finance, economics, etc. typically provide about half the credits necessary to earn an MBA degree. The other half comes from elective courses that you will have to choose from.
You may also choose a program model with your preferred focus in a specific industry such as sustainability, healthcare, sports management, etc.

You should, most importantly, make this choice between general management and specialization as fitted to your career goals.

The general management model offers you a break to pursue a range of opportunities and you can ultimately qualify for a C-suite job (CEO, CFO, CTO, COO, etc. positions).

The specific industry model offers depth in your chosen industry and helps you accelerate your advancement along that path.

Question 2
Independent self-learner or externally directed? What kind of student are you?

The courses are typically ‘self-paced’ so you will have more freedom in scheduling your classes. However, some offer limited two-way communication and stifled interactions which means inadequate relationship building, mentor input, or real-time student community participation.

Online programs offering more interaction are always more engaging and motivating for students who are basically self-learners. Real-time communication with classmates and instructors invites multiple perspectives and offers ways to analyze as well as solve problems.

Real-time communication models also foster enduring alliances and friendships with contemporary students as well as alums. Most programs with this model have a prescribed path to graduation.

Such online programs can help you stay on schedule and adequately paced toward completing your MBA studies. However, this model may offer less flexibility in scheduling classes and may also require more time to earn your degree.

Question 3

Many online MBA programs shave a required on-campus component, especially those from top-tier business schools.

So, what’s your preferred mix? How much of remote delivery versus on-campus delivery?

Lasting anywhere between 2-3 days and an entire week, on-campus residencies can take place at the start, middle, and/or towards the end of the program.

Models that require you to start with an on-campus component will do so mostly to get you acquainted with other signees and integrate you with your counterparts in the residential program.

Some colleges with this approach may also introduce you to experiential learning, and various clubs. This improves the chances of team projects, class trips, future cohort meetings, and on-site company visits.

B-schools offering on-campus residency towards the end of an online program do so to provide common “capstone” projects for their program just before completion.

For online students with significant professional or personal obligations, the schedule, time, and travel required to attend residencies can be difficult or even impossible. So, you must discuss this parameter in advance with your employer and/or family before deciding on the right model for you.

Question 4
What’s your ideal timeframe for completing an online MBA program?

The time frame for earning an MBA degree is another major consideration for online students. These courses may range from 10-24 months or up to several years. This must be considered with reference to your other goals.
Short programs can include less interaction with fellow students and faculty, more pre-recorded lectures, as well as the absence of a mandatory residential component.

Such programs typically offer fewer electives and a lesser number of extracurricular activities that include fewer real-time consulting, company visits, or team projects. This model, however, can provide you with flexibility as to when you want to “attend” your classes and focus your studies in a particular discipline.

Longer programs offer less flexibility however but offer more team projects, interaction, electives, and extracurricular. Additionally, students who go for this model typically sense a closer bond with the school’s culture, practices, and alumni network.
